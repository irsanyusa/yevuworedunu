Sometimes, movies’ creators aren’t entirely honest and tell&nbsp;us a&nbsp;fictional story based on&nbsp;the background of&nbsp;a&nbsp;real event, leading&nbsp;us to&nbsp;believe that the entire plot is&nbsp;real. Of&nbsp;course, this is&nbsp;not always the case. We’ve prepared several stories that were not only the basis for different films but the very heart of&nbsp;good films and&nbsp;TV series as&nbsp;well. <strong>But read carefully because this article contains spoilers!</strong></p><p>This article describes stories about relationships between real people that movie plots were built around. <strong>Bright Side</strong> even managed to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;weird but true story about a&nbsp;ghost that terrorized a&nbsp;family. You’ll have to&nbsp;see it&nbsp;for yourself.</p><p><h2>The story of&nbsp;Gypsy and Dee Dee Blanchard&nbsp;— TV&nbsp;show, The Act</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b38/e42/6233455034a3e27613bc479f3a.jpg><p>Dee Dee Blanchard was the perfect mother. But it&nbsp;was quite obvious that she had a&nbsp;tough life. Everyone knew that her daughter Gypsy was seriously ill. The girl had a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;diagnoses that couldn’t even fit on&nbsp;one page. She could only move in&nbsp;a&nbsp;wheelchair and couldn’t eat solid food because she underwent a&nbsp;gastric bypass. Gypsy also had trouble with her hearing and vision and even had several serious surgeries. Dee Dee kept <a href=#>taking</a> her daughter to&nbsp;different doctors and it&nbsp;seemed that she did everything she could to&nbsp;make her life easier.</p><p>In&nbsp;2015, Dee Dee was murdered in&nbsp;her own house. Her daughter went missing even though all her wheelchairs and oxygen tanks were left at&nbsp;home.</p><p>It&nbsp;turned out that the girl had talked a&nbsp;guy she knew from Facebook into killing her mother and after the murder, she escaped along with him. The medical examination showed that the suspect was completely healthy. All her diagnoses were made up&nbsp;by&nbsp;her mother who spent years giving her child unnecessary medical procedures. They were completely useless.</p><p><h2>Shelves of Gypsy's medications</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/822/e25/6fde825e59af60e20c4dff0324.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;was treated for asthma and convulsions. I&nbsp;took pills to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the toilet, I&nbsp;took painkillers, anti-anxiety medications. I&nbsp;used a&nbsp;breathing machine every evening. I&nbsp;hated it&nbsp;because it&nbsp;made breathing harder, not easier. And also, there was a&nbsp;machine for a&nbsp;feeding tube that controlled everything I&nbsp;ate. All my&nbsp;medications were given through the tube. I&nbsp;didn’t even wake up&nbsp;and my&nbsp;mother could give me&nbsp;anything.”</p><p>Gypsy was <a href=#>found guilty</a> as&nbsp;an&nbsp;accessory to&nbsp;murder, but they took mitigating circumstances (such as&nbsp;psychological violence) into account. The girl was sentenced to&nbsp;10&nbsp;years in&nbsp;prison with the possibility of&nbsp;parole.</p><p><strong>The TV&nbsp;show <a href=#>The Act</a> was based on&nbsp;her true story.</strong></p><p><h2>Observations in&nbsp;Mason County&nbsp;— movie, The Mothman Prophecies</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/28e/92d/ae4df25de8818ebd3c50e7e058.jpg><p>On&nbsp;November&nbsp;15, 1966, the Mason County police were <a href=#>contacted</a> by&nbsp;2&nbsp;young couples. They said that they had seen a&nbsp;strange creature that looked like a&nbsp;man with red glowing eyes that had wings. This thing allegedly chased their car for several miles.</p><p>It&nbsp;turned out that they weren’t the only people who saw this creature. The same day, gravediggers contacted the police and said that they had seen the same thing in&nbsp;the graveyard. A&nbsp;local fire crew came to&nbsp;the police with the same problems, describing it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;giant bird with huge red eyes. The locals started calling this figure The Mothman. The news about its appearance kept coming up&nbsp;until December&nbsp;15, 1967. After that, people stopped seeing&nbsp;it.</p><p>That day, in&nbsp;West Virginia, The Silver Bridge <a href=#>broke down</a>. The tragedy took the lives of&nbsp;46&nbsp;people. Paranormal investigators and ufologists <a href=#>connect</a> the tragedy with the appearance of&nbsp;the “thing”.</p><p><strong>The movie <a href=#>The Mothman Prophecies</a> was based on&nbsp;this story.</strong></p><p><h2>The story of&nbsp;Robledo Puch&nbsp;— movie, El&nbsp;Ángel</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d3b/1be/79543f5c7c9739b0d8b038725e.jpg><p>A&nbsp;man from <a href=# title=Argentina data-link=tag>Argentina</a>, <a href=#>Robledo Puch</a> was found guilty of&nbsp;committing 11&nbsp;murders and 25&nbsp;other crimes. He’s currently serving a&nbsp;life sentence in&nbsp;a&nbsp;high-security facility. But when you look at&nbsp;photos of&nbsp;this person, it’s hard to&nbsp;believe that he’s actually capable of&nbsp;committing these terrible crimes. So, because of&nbsp;how different his appearance is&nbsp;from his actions, he&nbsp;was named the Angel of&nbsp;Death.</p><p>Back when he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;high school, he&nbsp;met his future associates. They committed robberies and they never left any witnesses alive. Robledo’s associates also died under quite strange circumstances.</p><p>Puch was diagnosed with psychopathy accompanied by&nbsp;bursts of&nbsp;anger. Even in&nbsp;prison where he&nbsp;is&nbsp;now, he&nbsp;regularly shows very strange and aggressive behavior. This is&nbsp;why he&nbsp;continually doesn’t make parole: he’s still too dangerous to&nbsp;live among other people.</p><p>Puch became one of&nbsp;the most notorious criminals in&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;Argentina and <strong>his biography was the basis for the 2018&nbsp;film, <a href=#>El&nbsp;Ángel</a>.</strong></p><p><h2>Murderous dreams&nbsp;— film, A&nbsp;Nightmare on&nbsp;Elm Street</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/780/8fe/1e1c5a5e14aac3fdad522c8337.jpg><p>Once, director Wes Craven <a href=#>read</a> a&nbsp;story in&nbsp;the Los Angeles Times about a&nbsp;married couple that came to&nbsp;the&nbsp;US from Cambodia. The son of&nbsp;this couple was tortured by&nbsp;nightmares. They were so&nbsp;scary that the boy refused to&nbsp;fall asleep which was very bad for his health.</p><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, doctors recommended the couple change their place of&nbsp;living. The parents listened to&nbsp;the experts and moved to&nbsp;Los Angeles. When the child finally went to&nbsp;sleep, the parents thought that it&nbsp;was over, but at&nbsp;night, they heard their son scream. By&nbsp;the time they got into his room, the boy was already unconscious. They failed to&nbsp;save him.</p><p><strong>Craven was so&nbsp;blown away by&nbsp;this story that he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;shoot a&nbsp;movie <a href=#>A&nbsp;Nightmare on&nbsp;Elm Street</a></strong>. And it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;great decision. The story turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;really eerie and original and the viewers didn’t forget about the story long after watching.</p><p>It’s worth noting that there have been <a href=#>many cases</a> of&nbsp;people dying at&nbsp;night because of&nbsp;nightmares. And the circumstances are always the same: a&nbsp;person has a&nbsp;scary dream, they scream, and then their heart stops. Asian men are in&nbsp;a&nbsp;higher <a href=#>risk group</a>.</p><p><h2>The story of&nbsp;Yossi Ghinsberg&nbsp;— movie, Jungle</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0ef/1f4/0552245a3b86dac9bc60e2eca3.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1981, an&nbsp;ex-soldier of&nbsp;the Israeli navy, Yossi Ghinsberg, read an&nbsp;autobiographical book Papillon by&nbsp;Henri Charrière and was very inspired by&nbsp;the story. With his friend Marcus and two more guys, Kevin and Karl, Ghinsberg went on&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>trip</a> through the Bolivian rainforest.</p><p>Karl, who described himself as&nbsp;a&nbsp;geologist, promised to&nbsp;lead the pack of&nbsp;travelers to&nbsp;the territory of&nbsp;a&nbsp;remote tribe. They went down the Beni river and stayed in&nbsp;local villages. But soon, the travelers ran out of&nbsp;food and they started eating monkeys. The guys deviated from their planned track. More than that, it&nbsp;soon became obvious that Karl was not a&nbsp;geologist, he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;criminal who was an&nbsp;illicit gold miner. The tension was rising and the travelers decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;back.</p><p>Yossi and Kevin were supposed to&nbsp;travel by&nbsp;the river and Marcus and Karl who couldn’t swim decided to&nbsp;walk on&nbsp;foot. Because of&nbsp;a&nbsp;waterfall, Kevin’s and Yossi’s raft crashed, Kevin got to&nbsp;the shore and Yossi was dragged by&nbsp;the water. Yossi spent several days looking for his friend until he&nbsp;realized he&nbsp;was lost.</p><p>For 3&nbsp;weeks, Ghinsberg survived in&nbsp;the wild rainforest without any gear or&nbsp;food. He&nbsp;looked for food and tried to&nbsp;keep safe from predators. In&nbsp;the end, Kevin, who was saved by&nbsp;local fishermen, appeared with help. And we&nbsp;know nothing about what happened to&nbsp;Karl and Marcus.</p><p><strong>The film <a href=#>Jungle</a> starring Daniel Radcliff was based on&nbsp;this story.</strong></p><p><h2>The story of&nbsp;the Hodgson family&nbsp;— TV&nbsp;show, The Enfield Haunting</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a9c/491/9aabd054f3a2b2481a7e60e789.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1977, in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the houses in&nbsp;the English town of&nbsp;Enfield, a&nbsp;strange thing <a href=#>happened</a>. The Hodgson family, consisting of&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother and her 4&nbsp;children, were going out when suddenly, they heard unusual sounds. In&nbsp;the beginning, the mother thought that the girls were just messing around but soon, her doubts went away.</p><p>According to&nbsp;the story, when she entered the sisters’ room, a&nbsp;heavy cabinet that was on&nbsp;the wall started moving toward her. Miss Hodgson tried to&nbsp;push the piece of&nbsp;furniture away but it&nbsp;kept moving closer to&nbsp;her at&nbsp;a&nbsp;much faster pace. She said that she could hear someone’s feet walking on&nbsp;the floor.</p><p>The next day, they called the police but couldn’t explain the phenomenon and inventor Maurice Gross and writer Guy Lyon Playfair started investigating the event. They witnessed some other strange things in&nbsp;the house. They were even able to&nbsp;record one of&nbsp;the sisters speaking in&nbsp;someone else’s voice (they thought she was possessed by&nbsp;an&nbsp;old man’s spirit). You can hear the recording <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p>But later, the girls were accused of&nbsp;deception. But they said that they only rarely pranked the investigators to&nbsp;check out how competent they were.</p><p><strong>The show <a href=#>The Enfield Haunting</a> was based on&nbsp;this story.</strong></p><p><h2>The stories of&nbsp;Dennis Rader and Edmund Kemper&nbsp;— TV&nbsp;show, The Fall</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1c3/cc5/33621b56e18bb14c3208d5a8df.jpg><p>On&nbsp;April&nbsp;24, 1973, a&nbsp;seemingly nice man named Edmund Kemper was given 8&nbsp;life sentences. This suspect that gave off the impression of&nbsp;being a&nbsp;reasonable, kind man killed students along with his own relatives.</p><p>In&nbsp;2005, a&nbsp;man who seemed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;just as&nbsp;good as&nbsp;Kemper was also in&nbsp;the courtroom. He&nbsp;was also a&nbsp;good family man, Dennis Rader. As&nbsp;it&nbsp;turned out, his hobby was killing entire families. He&nbsp;dreamed of&nbsp;people writing articles about him on&nbsp;the front pages of&nbsp;newspapers. Later he&nbsp;told the police about these ideas. He&nbsp;was sentenced to&nbsp;life in&nbsp;prison.</p><p><strong>Both of&nbsp;these stories inspired the creators of&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV series <a href=#>The Fall</a> to&nbsp;write a&nbsp;detective script.</strong> The main role was played by&nbsp;Gillian Anderson.</p><p>What films do&nbsp;you like that are based on&nbsp;true events?
