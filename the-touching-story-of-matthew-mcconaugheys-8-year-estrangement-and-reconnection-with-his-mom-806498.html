Matthew McConaughey credits his&nbsp;Ma with his fame.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/124/361/932adf5020a015e762200055be.jpg><p>McConaughey remembers that growing&nbsp;up, he&nbsp;took part in&nbsp;a&nbsp;pageant, and she told him that he&nbsp;won “Little Mr. <a href=# title=Texas data-link=tag>Texas</a>.” When he&nbsp;looked at&nbsp;the winning picture closely, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>discovered</a> the trophy said: “Runner-up.” When McConaughey asked his mom, she simply said that the kid who won had more money and bought a&nbsp;3-piece suit, implying he&nbsp;won by&nbsp;cheating.</p><p>So&nbsp;for her, he&nbsp;was Little Mr. Texas. McConaughey said, “This is&nbsp;consistent behavior from my&nbsp;mother.” She has always had the utmost confidence in&nbsp;him.</p><p><h2>2. She always had his back, so&nbsp;now he&nbsp;has hers.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c4c/116/1fe3715b0296307bc7e116be70.jpg><p>McConaughey was headed to&nbsp;law school before the expense and other things changed his mind. He&nbsp;was wary about telling this to&nbsp;his parents, but <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>, “When I&nbsp;summoned up&nbsp;enough courage to&nbsp;tell them, there was a&nbsp;long silence. Then they asked, ’Is that what you want?’ I&nbsp;said, ’Yes.’ They said, ’You had better go&nbsp;and do&nbsp;it, then.’” So&nbsp;he&nbsp;did.</p><p>And today, when she wants to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;movie he’s doing, McConaughey introduces her to&nbsp;everyone around the set to&nbsp;make sure she can achieve her dreams as&nbsp;well.</p><p><h2>3. He&nbsp;appreciates the tough love he&nbsp;got from her.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7c2/0f7/0a2ba6511ba1270015c3e25614.jpg><p>Matthew never answers to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Matt</a>, never. And he&nbsp;learned his lesson well when he&nbsp;responded to&nbsp;a&nbsp;child calling him “Matt” one day in&nbsp;kindergarten and got a&nbsp;blasting from his mother. She told him that his name was Matthew and it&nbsp;meant something, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;should never answer to&nbsp;Matt. And so&nbsp;he&nbsp;doesn’t because she may be&nbsp;90, but Matthew is&nbsp;still a&nbsp;little scared of&nbsp;his&nbsp;Ma.</p><p><h2>4. He&nbsp;remained patient with her during some tough times.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/771/e3f/552d695f2aa20160f39cda2982.jpg><p>McConaughey’s mother did go&nbsp;a&nbsp;little overboard when he&nbsp;became famous, oversharing anecdotes about his childhood with the media. While McConaughey warned her not to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that, Kay could not stop. McConaughey remained patient with her, and while he&nbsp;still spoke to&nbsp;her, he&nbsp;stopped sharing <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>information</a> with her, to&nbsp;avoid any leaks considering his career was still just taking off.</p><p><h2>5. McConaughey patched things up&nbsp;with her after some sourness.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f7e/ed0/fe6d395cf3a238b86ef6129cd3.jpg><p>Of&nbsp;course, McConaughey loved his mother too much to&nbsp;let this become a&nbsp;permanent rift in&nbsp;their relationship. He&nbsp;waited until he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;big enough star and his career has stabilized enough to&nbsp;not let anything upset&nbsp;it. Then, he&nbsp;rekindled his relationship with his Ma.</p><p>He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a>, “My&nbsp;boat was built well enough that&nbsp;I didn’t think she could sink&nbsp;it, and then&nbsp;I just took the reins off and said, ’Mom, hit that red carpet. Talk to&nbsp;all of&nbsp;them, tell them all the stories you want!’ and she’s been great about it&nbsp;since.”</p><p><h2>6. He&nbsp;was okay with her putting Camila through her paces.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/87a/472/e8a6965e4a8338495645a32eb6.jpg><p>After mom and son made&nbsp;up, McConaughey started dating Camila Alves in&nbsp;2006. Kay made sure that her son was serious about the “right woman” by&nbsp;testing Alves, before giving her approval. Camila and Kay share a&nbsp;great relationship now, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> it&nbsp;on&nbsp;<i>The Drew Barrymore Show</i>.</p><p>Alves said, sitting with Ma&nbsp;Mac, “Throughout the time she’s been staying with&nbsp;us, we&nbsp;got to&nbsp;really connect and have fun together.” And McConaughey says his&nbsp;Ma taught him how to&nbsp;<a href=# title=respect data-link=tag>respect</a> women and it&nbsp;always stuck with him.</p><p><h2>7. The McConaugheys moved to&nbsp;Austin to&nbsp;be&nbsp;closer to&nbsp;Kay.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/88e/b0f/66148057248e21166278a99848.jpg><p>McConaughey and Alves tied the knot in&nbsp;2012 and have 3&nbsp;children together: Levi, 13, Vida, 12, and Livingston, 9. Matthew moved to&nbsp;Austin to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with his mother when she was 77. She’s 90&nbsp;now. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>actor</a> says, “I&nbsp;realize that is&nbsp;fourth quarter stuff, so&nbsp;I&nbsp;said, ’Let’s get down closer to&nbsp;mom.’ So&nbsp;now, we&nbsp;see her every weekend instead of&nbsp;twice a&nbsp;year. That was important to&nbsp;the kids, important to&nbsp;Camila and&nbsp;I, and important to&nbsp;my&nbsp;mom.”</p><p><h2>8. McConaughey and his&nbsp;Ma are open about their relationship hurdles too.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2e6/604/60993759ecbc3fe82db18a3ff1.jpg><p>McConaughey’s book, <i>Greenlights </i>is&nbsp;his love letter to&nbsp;life and has been collated from years of&nbsp;his journals. It’s a&nbsp;no-holds-barred peek into his childhood and his relationship with his parents, and later, his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mother</a>. The mother-son duo is&nbsp;open about the issues they had, and how they overcame them to&nbsp;become even stronger than before. After all, she has always supported him, and he&nbsp;knows&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>9. She’s often his date at&nbsp;events.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9b0/3dc/0ac3325e33a651e393fcb71d11.jpg><p>When the red carpet events happen, McConaughey takes his mother along as&nbsp;his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>date</a>, even after he&nbsp;got married. And he&nbsp;does not remember a&nbsp;day when she went to&nbsp;bed before or&nbsp;woke up&nbsp;after him the next morning.</p><p><h2>10. Matthew McConaughey can’t imagine life without his&nbsp;Ma.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/32d/1c0/6c19ac531aab185d08d0feb61f.jpg><p>McConaughey remembers to&nbsp;celebrate Ma&nbsp;Mac on&nbsp;his social media on&nbsp;the important days, from her 90th birthday to&nbsp;Mother’s day. And he&nbsp;admires her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>spirit</a> and her never-say-never attitude. As&nbsp;Matthew says, “Her favorite word is ‘yes.’”</p><p>In&nbsp;turn, Kate <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>marvels</a> at&nbsp;her son. Said she in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, “I&nbsp;look at&nbsp;these pictures [memorabilia she collected from his movies] and I&nbsp;go, ’Boy, what a&nbsp;life you’ve had, Matthew,’” she said. “I&nbsp;mean, just look at&nbsp;all the movies he’s been in&nbsp;and all the people he’s met, you know?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ce8/83e/35eb9a511cb4115186c5aed798.jpg><p>What kind of&nbsp;relationship do&nbsp;you have with your mother?
