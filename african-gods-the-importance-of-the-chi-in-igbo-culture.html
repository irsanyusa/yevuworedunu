It is a personal life force or, a person's providence, or a portioned-out life principle.</p><p>Chukwu created the world, then he put the creative spirit in the man known as his Chi to decide the course of his life.</p><p><strong>Chinua Achebe</strong> writes, "A man does not only have his own chi but is created by it and no two people, not even blood brothers, it seems, are created by the same chi."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>A way of saying we have individual destinies created by our individual Chis.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-6>But what does a Chi do?</h2></p><p>A common saying in Igbo culture is “Onye kwe chi ya ekwe” meaning, “If a person agrees to a thing, his spirit agrees to it too .”</p><p>Whatever a person experiences in life, the Chi is responsible. At the beginning of<strong> Buchi Emecheta’s</strong> novel, <strong>Joys of Motherhood</strong>, the protagonist <strong>Nnu Ego </strong>walks towards Carter Bridge to kill herself. As she walks towards the bridge, she berates her Chi on why she continually makes her experience misfortune.</p><p>She writes, "She would soon be there, she told herself. It would all soon be over, right there under the deep water that ran below Carter Bridge.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"Then she would be able to seek out and meet her chi , her personal god, and she would ask her why she had punished her so. She knew her chi was a woman, not just because to her way of thinking only a woman would be so thorough in punishing another."</p><p>According to renowned author <strong>Chinua Achebe</strong>,</p><p>“Chi is an individual's personal god which accounts for the fortune or misfortunes that one experiences in life."</p><p>A person works with his Chi to have either a good or a bad life.</p><p>Achebe continues, "Hence, the meaning of a person’s life is only realized as a collaborative venture…between his person and his chi."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"People often make statements like I am in agreement with my personal god or chi as a reference to the collaborative dimension in the individual/chi relationship. However, there are situations in a person’s life where it is believed that one’s chi may work against him.”</p><p><strong>Achebe</strong> says, "A man of impeccable character may yet have a bad chi so that nothing he puts his hand to will work out right. Chi is therefore more concerned with success or failure than with righteousness and wickedness."</p><p>In conclusion, a person’s Chi is responsible for their success or failure. If one succeeds or fails, the Chi has a role to play in it.</p><p>This does not depend on good or bad deeds. Being a good or moral person does not mean you will have a good Chi.</p><p>NB: African gods is a series on the mythology of African gods and goddesses.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmq6uZppq5cK3Fq6CcmZ5itLCw0maroZ1dnrqxu9GtmKeblWK8p3nToZxmm5ieeqq6jKKem6ddmMKtwNSrnGipmJmyp8PS</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
