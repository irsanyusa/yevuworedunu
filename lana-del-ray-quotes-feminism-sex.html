1) She’s “annoyed” that her sex life never helped her get a record deal.
Even though one of her new songs is called “F***ed My Way Up to the Top,” Del Rey told Complex magazine that sleeping with guys in the music industry has never helped her career."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She’s getting flak right now for the first item listed below, but why are we surprised? She’s always got something offbeat and amazing to say.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>1) She’s “annoyed” that her sex life never helped her get a record deal.</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Even though one of her new songs is called “F***ed My Way Up to the Top,” Del Rey told Complex <a href=# rel=noopener>magazine</a> that sleeping with guys in the music industry has never helped her career.</p><figure class=text-left readability=27><p>You know, I have slept with a lot of guys in the industry. But none of them helped me get my record deals. Which is annoying.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Earlier, she said:</p><figure class=text-left readability=28.5><p>I relate to being the person who people come to for “such a change from the old routine,” but not being the main thing. I had a long-term relationship for seven years with someone who was the head of a label and I felt like I was that change of routine. I was always waiting to become the person who his kids came home to, and it never happened.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s important to note that most of the coverage of this controversial quote has focused on the “I have slept with a lot of guys” part, not the effect it might have had on her career. Several big media outlets put the quote in their headlines, which can come off as slut-shaming.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>2) Tesla is way cooler than feminism.</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a recent interview in <a href=# rel=noopener>Fader</a> magazine, she made it clear where she stands on the age-old Feminists vs. Aliens debate:</p><figure class=text-left readability=30><p>“For me, the issue of feminism is just not an interesting concept. I’m more interested in, you know, SpaceX and Tesla, what’s going to happen with our intergalactic possibilities. Whenever people bring up feminism, I’m like, god. I’m just not really that interested.”</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Feminist aliens have yet to weigh in.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>3) She kind of has a death wish.</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">She once told <a href=# rel=noopener>The Guardian </a>that she admired Amy Winehouse and Kurt Cobain so much that “I wish I were dead already,” which led to a lengthly discussion of mortality:</p><figure class=text-left readability=33><p>Interviewer: Is early death glamorous?</p><p>“I don’t know. Ummm, yeah.”</p><p>Interviewer: Don’t say that</p><p>“I do! I don’t want to have to keep doing this. But I am.</p><p>Interviewer: Do what? Make Music?</p><p>“Everything. That’s just how I feel. If it wasn’t that way, then I wouldn’t say it. I would be scared if I knew [death] was coming, but …”</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The singer <a href=# rel=noopener>retracted her comments</a> afterward on Twitter in a series of now-deleted tweets, saying the interviewer had asked her leading questions.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>4) Her friend Juliette Lewis didn’t realize that was her on SNL.</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In outtakes from this month’s <a href=# rel=noopener>Rolling Stone</a> profile, Del Rey reveals that she was friends with Juliette Lewis before the actress publicly dissed her Saturday Night Live performance:</p><figure class=text-left readability=29.5><p>I was actually friends with her before that but she didn’t know it was me on TV. I had been more blonde before or something. She called me and was like, ‘Oh, I’m so sorry.’ But we got over it. Because the truth is, we’re birds of a feather in a way. In the end, we thought it was really funny.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Because messing up your friend’s hair color can happen to anybody!</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>5) Every day is Opposite Day.</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Because Lana Del Rey is George Constanza:</p><figure class=text-left readability=28><p>“I’m really specific about why I’m doing something or writing something. But it always kind of gets translated in the opposite fashion. I haven’t done it yet, but I’ve learned that everything I’m going to do is going to have the opposite reaction of what I meant. So I should do the opposite if I want a good reaction.”</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When Rolling Stone pointed out that George already tried this, she says, “Oh really? That’s awesome. Me and George Costanza!”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>6) She mixes up sounds and colors.</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It sounds like the directions she gave to <a href=# rel=noopener>Ultraviolence producer </a>Dan Auerbach were, um, confusing (also from the Rolling Stone outtakes:)</p><figure class=text-left readability=30><p>“I would explain things to him in terms of colors and touchstone words,” she says. “My word for the record was ‘fire,’ you know, blue fire, when a flame gets so hot it goes from red to blue. And I told him I wanted everything to sound like it was in the key of blue. And I think at first he was like, ‘What the f*ck?'”</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This was mostly to distinguish from Lady Gaga, who wants everything to sound like it’s in the key of rainbows.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZsaGJtg3SAjqWYp5ldmbKtedGasGappaTBpr%2BMn5ymoZ6ewK550p6vaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
