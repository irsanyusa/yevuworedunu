The small, proud community of Glen Ridge, New Jersey, has been in pain ever since four young football players from the local high school were accused in 1989 of luring a 17-year- old retarded girl into a basement and penetrating her with a broomstick handle and a baseball bat, while a group of friends watched. Last week three of those charged, Christopher Archer, now 20, and 21-year-old twins Kevin and Kyle Scherzer, were found guilty of sexual assault. All four, including Bryant Grober, 21, were convicted of conspiracy.</p><p>During the trial, it was the shakiest testimony that counted most. The victim, who is now 21 but has the intelligence of an 8-year-old, took the stand in December and, eager to please whichever lawyer questioned her, told a story full of contradictions and surprising affection for her attackers. Instead of sealing an acquittal, however, her testimony convinced the jury that the girl was incapable of informed consent and that the well-spoken young men sitting in the courtroom should have known better. Archer and the Scherzers could face sentences of up to 40 years. Since their lawyers plan appeals, Glen Ridge may not yet be able to close its wound altogether.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6PBprrTZ6uipZVjsLC5jq2gpp1fqMKjv8KroJudomSus8DInKOeZ2BhgHR8j3Jjcm9oZYV2eI9pZaGsnaE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
