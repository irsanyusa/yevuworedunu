Heidi said that Daniela looks a bit like her youngest daughter Lou. When Heidi asked who the boss in the partnership is, Daniela confidently said “me.”</p><p>“In my house, the girls are the bosses too,” Heidi said. She was also curious what the adorable dancing duo would do with the prize money if they won the show. Daniela said she would give money to the poor and also buy a mansion.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link> 5-YEAR-OLD CHANNELS HER INNER SHIRLEY TEMPLE AND NAILS THE SONG AND MOVES ON ‘AGT’ [VIDEO]</a></strong></p><p>“I’m going to save some for college,” Yasha said which had the whole audience laughing. The pair started off their routine dancing a samba to “Shake Senora” by Pitbull. It was the perfect combination of technical dance skills and fun crowd-pleasing moments. The music then transitioned to “Proud Mary” by Tina Turner. The pair that have been dancing together since they were 3 years old garnered huge cheers from the crowd.</p><p>“Amazing. I love you two. I can’t believe the way you can shake those hips around” Heidi said after watching Yasha and Daniela’s performance. “I wish I could do that like that. I might have to get some training from you.”</p><p>“You were just so on time and on point with the hand movements, hips and everything,” Mel B said. “The whole routine was just great. I’m kind of speechless actually.” Howie Mandel was just blown away by the fact that the pair have been dancing together since they were toddlers.
