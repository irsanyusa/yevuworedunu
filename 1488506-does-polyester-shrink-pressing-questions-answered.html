That said, clothing made out of artificial fabrics may need to be shrunk from time to time. The secret is to use extremely hot water, causing the fibres to shrink.</p><h2>What causes shrinkage in polyester fabrics?</h2><p class=align-left>A combination of heat and water causes shrinkage in <a href=#>polyester fabrics</a>. When exposed to both, the fibres in the fabric contract, causing the fabric to become smaller. It can happen during washing, drying, or ironing. To avoid shrinkage, wash synthetic garments in cool water and tumble dry on low heat.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2ba9860285a706f6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to shrink polyester clothes without ruining the garment</span></p></a><h2>Does polyester shrink in the dryer?</h2><p class=align-left>Polyester is a synthetic fabric, which means it's made from petroleum products. In general, synthetic fabrics are less likely to shrink in the dryer than natural fabrics like cotton or wool.</p><p class=align-left>All fabrics can shrink when exposed to high heat, so it's always best to check the care label before tossing any item in the dryer. The fabric is less likely to shrink if the care label says tumble dry on low.</p><h2>Does polyester shrink through wash drying?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2ba9860285a706f6.jpg><p class=align-left>Polyester is heat sensitive. That means it can start to shrink when exposed to high temperatures, like those found in a washing machine or dryer. However, it's not the only type of fabric that shrinks through the drying process.</p><p class=align-left>Some prefer cotton because it doesn't shrink nearly as much as synthetic clothes. But if you wash and dry both cotton and polyester together, the cotton will shrink even more than the polyester would have on its own.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d689c907897d9901.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to remove super glue from plastic, metal, glass, wood or fabric</span></p></a><h2>How can I shrink polyester?</h2><p class=align-left>There are several ways that artificial fibres can shrink. First, the garment could be put in a hot dryer. Second, it could be washed and dried at too high of a temperature.</p><p class=align-left>Third, the fabric could be tightly squeezed in the dryer to remove excess water and then left to dry without the clothes touching each other.</p><p class=align-left>Fourth, when washing the garment with other items that are not made from natural fibres, it will absorb some or all of those fabrics' shrinking properties and thus become smaller.</p><h2>Does 100% polyester shrink?</h2><p class=align-left>If you're wondering if 100% polyester fabric will shrink when washed, the answer is usually yes. Polyester is a synthetic material, and it's prone to shrinking when exposed to heat or water.</p><p class=align-left>That's why it's important to read the care label before washing any garment made with artificial fibre. If the care label says dry clean only, that's probably your best bet.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1d2752b54df4b70d.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to get slime out of clothes, carpet, hair and other surfaces: Top methods</span></p></a><h2>How much does polyester shrink?</h2><p class=align-left>Like most synthetic fabrics, polyester is less likely to shrink than natural fibres like cotton and wool. However, artificial fibre can still shrink under the right (or wrong) conditions.</p><p class=align-left>Polyester can generally shrink about 5-10% when exposed to high heat. It's more likely for a blend of 80% cotton to shrink up to 5%.</p><h2>Does polyester shrink when washed?</h2><p class=align-left>Polyester is an artificial fabric that is popular because it is durable and easy to care for. It is often used in blends with other fabrics because it doesn't shrink when washed.</p><p class=align-left>However, 100% polyester garments can shrink if not laundered properly. Therefore, it is important to read the instructions on the label before washing any garment made from polyester or any blended fabric containing artificial fibre.</p><p class=align-left>Generally speaking, these instructions recommend you machine wash the garment cold and then tumble dry on low heat or air dry.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2e66be008f3ae79e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Activated carbon face mask: a step-by-step recipe</span></p></a><h2>Does polyester shrink when dried?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f2c998c731bb036a.jpg><p class=align-left>It's a common misconception that polyester is a low-maintenance fabric and doesn't require much care. However, drying it on a hot setting will cause it to shrink, so it's best to avoid drying it in the dryer if possible.</p><p class=align-left>It should be hung or laid flat to dry. Lint should be removed from the fabric before any work with an iron or steamer, as it will make them difficult to use on artificial fibre. Polyester has low wrinkle resistance, so steamers are often recommended for maintenance.</p><h2>Does polyester shrink more than cotton?</h2><p class=align-left>Cotton and polyester behave differently under heat exposure. Artificial fibre is less likely to shrink than cotton, but it can still happen, especially if the garment is in the dryer on high heat.</p><p class=align-left>To avoid shrinking your <a id=https://www.legit.ng/1218053-latest-african-fashion-dresses-ladies.html href=#>polyester clothes</a>, wash them in cold water and hang them to dry.

Here are a few tips:</p><ul><li>Always read the care label before washing. Washing in hot water or drying on high heat can cause synthetic clothing to shrink.</li><li>Use lukewarm water and dry on a low or delicate setting.</li><li>Avoid overloading the washing machine or dryer, which can also cause the clothes to shrink.</li><li>If you must wash in hot water, add a cup of vinegar to the cycle.</li></ul><h2>Does polyester shrink in cold water?</h2><p class=align-left>Polyester does not shrink in cold or warm water; however, washing it in hot water can cause a tiny amount of shrinking. You may take precautions by turning the garment inside out before laundering it, avoiding bleach, and drying on low heat.</p><p class=align-left>The dryer is a major cause of shrinkage, so air-drying clothes whenever possible is recommended to avoid this problem altogether. In addition, it's best to hang items from wide hangers with plenty of space between them rather than bunch them together with narrow hangers.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/61088dcfdfc658b2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Use body scrubs effectively with these simple tips</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It's also essential to use a <a href=#>suitable detergent</a> — a high-quality detergent will help extend the clothing life and reduce any risk for shrinkage due to excessive agitation during washing or machine wear.</p><h2>Does polyester shrink in hot water?</h2><p class=align-left>Polyester is an artificial fabric, so it's less likely to shrink in hot water than a natural fibre like cotton. However, it's still possible for artificial fibre to experience some shrinking if exposed to extreme heat.</p><p class=align-left>The best way to avoid this is to wash your polyester clothing in cool or lukewarm water and avoid using hot water altogether when possible. If you do need to use hot water, make sure to select the delicate cycle on your washing machine. Add an extra rinse at the end of the cycle.</p><p class=align-left>In the end, does polyester shrink? This is an important question, as the answer is often different depending on the fabric. If a garment is made with 100% synthetic fibre like polyester, it should not shrink unless exposed to extreme temperatures. However, if it's a mix, shrinking may occur if the fabric is treated incorrectly.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/80471444bc7f64be.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Styling short natural hair: tips and styles</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong><a href=#>40+ native styles for men for 2022: All the latest designs to rock this year</a></p><p class=align-left>Legit.ng recently published an article that featured 40+ <a href=#>native styles for men</a> to wear in 2022.
