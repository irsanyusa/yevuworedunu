With a little dedication and the right products, you too can achieve a glowing complexion and luscious locks.</p><p>In his routine, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Horan</a> starts with a splash of cold water and a gentle cleanse, followed by a Make Beauty exfoliating mask. He then goes on to facial steaming to open his pores and increase product absorption. Horan is a big believer in steam and even finds it helpful for his voice. To combat undereye puffiness, Horan applies Jaxon Lane patches and also massages his face with ice rollers.</p><p>Horan’s hydrating cocktail includes Sarah Chapman’s serum, facial oil, and hyaluronic-acid-infused face cream. He completes his routine with Ilia’s dark-circle-alleviating eye cream, SPF, and lip balm for a glowing complexion.</p><p>For hair, Horan prefers a lived-in, natural look. He uses Leonor Greyl mousse and the Dyson Supersonic to style his chestnut locks. He finishes his hair care routine with Stmnt’s paste and Balmain’s strong-hold hairspray for added texture.</p><p>Horan also reveals his secret to smelling good – a spritz of deodorant and Le Labo Santal 33.</p><p>This 22-step beauty regimen may seem daunting, but Horan stresses the importance of taking care of your skin and hair.

From recording and also touring to his stint as a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">coach</a> on The Voice, Horan’s time is often stretched thin.</p><p>With such a busy schedule, it’s no surprise that Horan doesn’t always have the time for his full 22-step beauty routine. While he loves taking care of his skin and hair, he knows that sometimes he needs to prioritize other things.</p><p>While he may not always have the luxury of time to indulge in his full beauty routine, Horan knows the importance of taking care of himself both inside and out. With his busy schedule, it’s impressive that he still finds ways to prioritize his self-care, even if it’s just a few quick steps.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Original_BrownBrothers_Amy-SussmanGetty-Images.jpg alt="Gabriel Brown from ‘AGT’s Brown Brothers Does a Stunt for MrBeast" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zaKYpaRdnbyzrc1mqZ6ulZa5tHnHoqpmamJiwLWxz2aZnpmlqcZuvs6uq6KmlWLBqa3TZpinsZ%2Bjsm6vwKdkraeklrmtxYydpmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
