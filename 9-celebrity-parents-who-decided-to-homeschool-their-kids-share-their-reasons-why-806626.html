However, choosing to homeschool them is a big decision — as certain aspects like finance, dedication, and time all come into play to make it work effectively.

Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/81a/270/f386cd59e8bb5d23edfa811917.jpg><p>Will and Jada both agree that homeschooling their children was essential to&nbsp;their well-being. The decision to&nbsp;educate their kids out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;school environment came from their big travel schedule&nbsp;— but they also believe that the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>school</a> system (both public and private) is&nbsp;“designed for the industrial age” and we&nbsp;are all currently in&nbsp;a&nbsp;technological age. They don’t want their kids to&nbsp;memorize, but rather actually learn.</p><p><h2>2. Kris Jenner and Caitlyn Jenner</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ba9/ea8/e17ef25e828532e92abbb291c4.jpg><p>Kendall and Kylie performed poorly in&nbsp;school because they often missed classes due to&nbsp;their careers, and they weren’t able to&nbsp;be&nbsp;completely <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>creative</a> in&nbsp;the everyday school environment, which lead them to&nbsp;be&nbsp;disinterested in&nbsp;continuing.</p><p>However, they applied to&nbsp;a&nbsp;homeschooling agency called Novel Education, which helps people who travel a&nbsp;lot. They had a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;choose the courses they wanted to&nbsp;take and shape a&nbsp;successful career simultaneously.</p><p><h2>3. Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2e9/077/9e9f5252479cf9684758d3a8c3.jpg><p><a href=# title="Angelina Jolie" data-link=tag>Angelina Jolie</a> believes that “we&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;different <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>age</a>, and the education system hasn’t caught up&nbsp;with our children or&nbsp;our way of&nbsp;life.” Since the <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> travels a&nbsp;lot, she wants her kids to&nbsp;enjoy doing other things such as&nbsp;visiting a&nbsp;museum or&nbsp;reading a&nbsp;book they love, instead of&nbsp;getting homework done as&nbsp;quickly as&nbsp;possible.</p><p>Angelina also didn’t want her adopted kids to&nbsp;skip out on&nbsp;their culture. She wanted them to&nbsp;learn more about their ethnicities. So, she hired a&nbsp;Vietnamese-speaking tutor and a&nbsp;teacher with an&nbsp;African background to&nbsp;connect with her children.</p><p><h2>4. Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f25/dec/2f78fa5799b203b4184b8f36f4.jpg><p><a href=# title="Katie Holmes" data-link=tag>Katie Holmes</a> and <a href=# title="Tom Cruise" data-link=tag>Tom Cruise</a> are quite busy with their work schedules, so&nbsp;home-schooling their daughter Suri was the ideal solution. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Suri</a> has a&nbsp;teacher who is&nbsp;with her every day, and they find the one-on-one education very useful and favorable. Katie says that her daughter is&nbsp;very strong-willed and determined, and that it’s important to&nbsp;go&nbsp;with what the child wants.</p><p><h2>5. Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7be/6a9/87da0a53e98af5c87110d5d1bd.jpg><p><a href=# title="Jennifer Lopez" data-link=tag>Jennifer Lopez</a> has 2&nbsp;twins, Emme and Max. She believes that they are <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>happy</a>, well-adjusted, loving, and caring kids. Jennifer says that the most important thing for them is&nbsp;to&nbsp;spend time with their mother, so&nbsp;they don’t feel abandoned by&nbsp;a&nbsp;parent, that’s why homeschooling was a&nbsp;great option for the family.</p><p><h2>6. Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ae9/a57/361cb159859520be5ea388fc27.jpg><p>Gwyneth and Chris believe that the British Education system “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lacks</a> traditional elements of&nbsp;classical thought and learning.” They wanted a&nbsp;tutor to&nbsp;be&nbsp;humorous, sporty, youthful, easygoing, and enjoy life.</p><p>They expected the tutor to&nbsp;travel with them everywhere and teach their children, Apple and Moses&nbsp;— offering things like Greek, Latin, and French, along with sailing and tennis lessons.</p><p><h2>7. Michael Jackson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f81/798/61c6bd52fe90364085238f0e86.jpg><p><a href=# title="Michael Jackson" data-link=tag>Michael Jackson</a>’s kids were homeschooled while he&nbsp;was alive, and he&nbsp;was always very protective of&nbsp;them. He&nbsp;told his daughter, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Paris</a>, that she could do&nbsp;anything that makes her happy, “an&nbsp;astronaut, a&nbsp;vet, and a&nbsp;nurse.”</p><p>She was homeschooled for the first 12&nbsp;years of&nbsp;her life, and the only interactions she had were with her family members or&nbsp;other adults. She said she didn’t have any social skills, and had to&nbsp;force herself to&nbsp;learn very fast, but she has gotten pretty good at&nbsp;it&nbsp;over the years.</p><p><h2>8. James and Kimberly Van Der Beek</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/761/897/e626d15cc49476b2144fe98f57.jpg><p>This lovely family has tried “many <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>variations</a>” to&nbsp;teach their children, like the traditional homeschooling in&nbsp;their home. Kimberly says that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;amazing experience and that parents who are thinking about educating their children at&nbsp;home should not stress.</p><p>She believes that school is&nbsp;a&nbsp;form of&nbsp;imprisonment and that teachers put way too much pressure on&nbsp;kids. They are told, for hours, what to&nbsp;do&nbsp;and what they should learn. In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;have strong, creative, self-sufficient children, they should learn to&nbsp;make their own decisions.</p><p><h2>9. Richard Williams</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b76/444/bc1c96511c9991979d7e556248.jpg><p>Both Serena Williams and her sister, Venus, were homeschooled by&nbsp;their father, Richard. Since their careers were sport-based, it&nbsp;was crucial for them to&nbsp;focus more on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tennis</a>, so&nbsp;their father homeschooled them from elementary school all the way through high school. This way they had more time to&nbsp;shift their attention to&nbsp;tennis.</p><p>Did you homeschool your children? Would you consider giving it&nbsp;a&nbsp;try?</p><p>In&nbsp;her unique parenting approach, Angelina Jolie has established <a href=#>six distinctive rules</a> that have won the hearts of&nbsp;many. These include a&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;experiential learning, a&nbsp;balanced diet that includes junk food, and an&nbsp;emphasis on&nbsp;individuality and freedom of&nbsp;expression.</p><p>The highly anticipated sequel, “Top Gun: Maverick,” showcases Tom Cruise’s <a href=#>commitment to&nbsp;authenticity</a>. Opting for real jets instead of&nbsp;CGI, Cruise and the production team went to&nbsp;great lengths to&nbsp;capture genuine aerial sequences. This dedication extended to&nbsp;the actors undergoing rigorous training to&nbsp;handle the intense physical demands of&nbsp;filming in&nbsp;real jets. The film, which took 36&nbsp;years to&nbsp;release after the original, promises to&nbsp;deliver the same adrenaline-pumping action that fans loved in&nbsp;the 1986&nbsp;classic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIZur8SlnJuqmanGbrzAq5ynrKNixKm7jJ2cnKGUmrFuwM5mn6illaiwqbvOpWStoJWev263yJ2qZquYlr%2BmedOhnKKqXaeyor%2FOp6pmr5iuenl8lW9pb2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
