This Riviera-based frappé is an object lesson in how times change though plots do not. Hope Lange is a chauffeur-chasing heiress who chases Chauffeur Glenn Ford, lures him to a booby-trapped love nest, and almost nabs him. Charles Boyer runs a school for would-be grooms, where Pupil Ricardo Montalban learns that even the aging Boyer is not yet a Casbah Milquetoast.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Five Miles to Midnight. Sophia Loren and Tony Perkins in a thriller that might have been a sort of Psycaccio. But this film about a neurotic ne’er-do-well who escapes from a plane wreck believed to have killed him and forces his wife to go along with a plot to collect his life insurance, is good, solid black-and-white suspense stuff.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Birds. Hitchcock-a-doodle-doo in the form of a fatuous plot makes for a slow start; but when the birds finally get a chance to do their stuff, the feathers fly as hordes of gulls, finches and crows go to war against humanity.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Courtship of Eddie’s Father. A whole new era of Hollywood kiddy stars may be launched by irresistibly talented Ronny Howard, 9. He does a pro job at finding a mate for Daddy Glenn Ford, Shirley Jones, Dina Merrill and Stella Stevens are the applicants.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Balcony. Jean Genet’s allegory says that life is a bawdyhouse where men buy illusions at the price of their masculinity. Shelley Winters is the madam who knows what her customers want.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Mondo Cane. Some episodes in this stomach-churning travelogue are almost Swiftian in their comment on human frailty. Others are simply funny. But the best/worst parts provide some of the bloodiest minutes to hit the screen in a long time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">How the West Was Won. This Cinerama epic goes wild and woolly with a wagonload of stars and a thousand thundering buffaloes that threaten to shake the balcony loose from its moorings.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To Kill a Mockingbird. Harper Lee’s Pulitzer Prize novel comes off almost better on the screen than on the page. Gregory Peck is wise and warm, and three children—Mary Badham, Phillip Alford and John Megna—are so convincingly rambunctious that they hardly seem to be acting at all.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Love and Larceny. Vittorio Gassman masquerades his way through one of the funniest Italian farces of the season.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Wrong Arm of the Law.

Brecht robs his 17th century heroine of her three children without breaking her fierce will to survive. In the daunting title role, Anne Bancroft unfortunately is not quite the earth mother she strives to be.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Too True to Be Good, by George Bernard Shaw. This gallimaufry of tired Shavianisms on the religious temper, the military mind, and the desperate plight of the idle rich is a theatrical sleeping pill. A full cast of stars—Glynis Johns, Robert Preston, David Wayne, Cyril Ritchard, Eileen Heckart, Lillian Gish, Cedric Hardwicke, Ray Middleton—try to wake the play up.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tovarich explores new frontiers of boredom in an unmusical noncomedy. As a White Russian grand duchess posing as a housemaid in Paris in 1927, lovely Vivien Leigh does a Charleston to remember, and otherwise lights up the proceedings like a matchflare in a catacomb.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Strange Interlude, by Eugene O’Neill. Time has added a comic flavor to this 4½-hour Freudian opus that the somber-spirited playwright never never intended. However, O’Neill’s innate theater sense saves all but the silliest lines, and the playing of effulgent Geraldine Page and her Actors Studio cohorts is a delight to behold.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Enter Laughing, by Joseph Stein. There is an improvisational air to this play that lends freshness to a stalely familiar genre, the Jewish family comedy. As a youngster with a yen to act, Alan Arkin is rib-splittingly funny.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Photo Finish, by Peter Ustinov, is an amiable piece of geriatrickery. Miming an 80-year-old, Ustinov has the dubious but distinct pleasure of meeting his bygone selves of 20, 40 and 60. The multiaptituded Ustinov also meets himself as author and director.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, by Edward Albee. Rasping family squabbles are the scenes U.S. playwrights handle best, and this savage-witted nightlong bout of man and wife ranks with the best of the breed. Arthur Hill and Uta Hagen are the battlers.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Never Too Late, by Sumner Arthur Long. Paul Ford’s preternatural gloom at the thought of becoming a father at 60 provokes a two-hour hailstorm of pelting laughs.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Little Me. Seven helpings of Sid Caesar make this show a rich musical comedy feast. Other goodies include Swen Swenson’s dancing and Virginia Martin’s ding-dong Belle Poitrine.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Beyond the Fringe. Four wickedly clever young English sharpshooters riddle such sacred institutions as God, Shakespeare and Harold Macmillan. The wackiest loon of the lunatic lot is Dr. Jonathan Miller.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Off Broadway</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To the Water Tower. There is bee-stinging humor and zany, zooming fantasy in this new satirical revue by the Second City troupe as it buzzes busily around Cuba, camp counselors and bomb shelter salesmen.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Six Characters in Search of an Author employs the arena stage with remarkable intelligence and achieves a model revival of the Pirandello classic. The play is a philosophical melodrama in which illusion wrestles with reality and both ambiguously exchange identities. William Ball’s direction is organic, coursing like blood along a vein to the heart of the play, which is the mind.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Tiger and The Typists, by Murray Schisgal. The eupeptic pleasure with which Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson cavort through these two clever one-acters is highly contagious. The Tiger is the better play, as it hoists two engineers of nonconformist clichés on their own pretentious petard.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Dumbwaiter and The Collection, by Harold Pinter, are shivery comedies of menace in which murder and infidelity occur (or do they?), and meaning is made mysterious and mystery meaningful.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">RECORDS</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sheherazade (Columbia) is a passionate performance of Maurice Ravel’s coldly exciting music, with Mezzo-Soprano Jennie Tourel sharing the enthusiasm built behind her by Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic. Berlioz’ Cléopátre, on the other side, is less remarkable music.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Poulenc: Concerto in D Minor (Angel) features the late Francis Poulenc and Jacques Fevrier as the two pianists in Poulenc’s familiar and joyously baroque double concerto. Concert Champétre for Harpsichord and Orchestra, on the other side, is not vintage Poulenc, though played with mercurial zeal by Harpsichordist Aimée van de Wiele.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Liszt: Concerto No. 1, Les Préludes (Andre Watts, pianist; the New York Philharmonic, conducted by Leonard Bernstein; Columbia) confirms the astonishing first impression 16-year-old Pianist Watts made in his New York debut in January. A fluent and subtle performance.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Bruckner: Mass No. 3 in F Minor (Berlin Symphony, St. Hedwig’s Cathedral Choir, conducted by Karl Forster; Pilar Lorengar, soprano, Christa Ludwig, alto, Josef Traxel, tenor, Walter Berry, bass; Angel) is a majestic work. Forster matches the full voice of his orchestra to the choral glories of the Mass, and only Soprano Lorengar’s obvious struggling brings him down to earth again.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Bartok: Bluebeard’s Castle (Mercury) is a worthy love offering by the friends of the late Bela Bartok. It is an all-Hungarian recording of Bartok’s only opera, with Old Friend Basso Mihaly Szekely singing the lead and Old Friend Antal Dorati conducting. The performances are more devoted than the music justifies: the opera remains a penny poem.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Nielsen: Symphony No. 5 (New York Philharmonic, conducted by Leonard Bernstein; Columbia) is an excited reading of the seldom heard work of the late Danish composer Carl Nielsen. Nielson’s melodious, strongly rhythmed music sounds like a primer to Shostakovich, and Bernstein makes the most of all its frenzied drama. It is, above all, a showcase for the New York Philharmonic’s superb percussionists.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Purcell: Come, Ye Sons of Art (Alfred Deller, countertenor; Vanguard) is a happy new appearance of Purcell’s birthday music for Queen Mary, this time with Deller and his countertenor son Mark sharing the sublime duet that crowns the work.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Vivaldi: Gloria (Roger Wagner Chorale; Angel) is a glittering rendition of Vivaldi at his festive best. The choir gets a bit thick at times, but the soloists are excellent and the recording is rich and sonorous.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Oistrakh (Monitor) presents David Oistrakh and his son Igor in a good collection of works for virtuoso violins: Haydn’s Duo in B-Flat, Prokofiev’s Sonata for Two Violins, Honegger’s Sonatina, and Louis Spohr’s Duetto II in D Major. The Oistrakhs play magnificently.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">BOOKS</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Best Reading</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Speculations About Jakob, by Uwe Johnson. One of Germany’s most gifted young novelists finds the death—by suicide or accident—of a humble East German line dispatcher an excuse to delve provocatively and perceptively into the small tensions and the human concerns of a divided world.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Great Hunger, by Cecil Woodham-Smith.

Parables by a pseudonymous Soviet writer that illustrate by the light of fantasy how the eye of Big Brother orders the realities of Soviet life.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lawd Today, by Richard Wright. Written before Native Son, but now published for the first time (three years after Wright’s death), this novel of a brutalized Chicago Negro in the 1930s is a grim reminder of a time, not long ago, when the pain caused by race prejudice was mainly economic.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Conservative Enemy, by C.A.R. Crosland. A hard-minded British socialist has at fossilized economic thinking of dogmatists in his own party.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A Favorite of the Gods, by Sybille Bedford. Grand opera without music, about the dynastic rich of 19th century Europe, by a novelist with a fine feel for the trials of being wellborn.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Revolution, by Hannah Arendt. In a shrewd study, Historian Arendt examines the long-held notion that revolutions cure social ills, concludes that most of them do more harm than good.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That Summer in Paris, by Morley Callaghan.
