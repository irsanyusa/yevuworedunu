The telenovela had Jennifer De La Vega</strong></p><p>De La Vega was the perfect jealous psycho ex girlfriend of the lead actor, Carlos Eduardo. The ‘jilted lover’ plot is a popular one in telenovelas, and “Gardener’s Daughter” gave us the perfect one in the sexy and beautiful character Jennifer. We also remember that her character ended in a psychiatric asylum.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>2. Villains</strong></p><p>That is one thing telenovelas always cast well. Is it possible to forget Luisa Alejandro, who is probably the most conniving antagonist to grace screens in the telenovela world? In the series, he was the father of lead actress Luisa Fernanda.</p><p>He rejected her mother because he wanted more from life - money, power and all the good things of life. Fast forward to the future and he found himself battling his daughter(as expected, he didn’t even know of her existence. We all know how their secret keeping theme plays out). His character was finally sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.</p><p>ALSO READ:</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>3. Luisa Fernanda and Carlos Eduardo!</strong></p><p>Maybe they didn’t present us with all the chemistry we enjoyed from <a id=32cdd028-07ab-5adb-9919-0185b49a6883 href=#>undefined</a> but the couple were every shade of beautiful, and a delight to watch on screen. From their fights to makeups, Luisa keeping their child a secret to Carlos finding out, the love story between a handsome doctor and a talented smart young lady was indeed an interesting watch.</p><p><strong>4. The battle for inheritance</strong></p><p>That is one thing that was never found missing in ‘ancient’ days telenovela, and “Gardener’s Daughter” gave us one of the most suspense filled battle of inheritance.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>From Consuelo trying to kill Luisa for being the ignorant but true heiress to her father’s fortune, to her stealing the will just so Luisa doesn’t find out she’s a billionaire. Consuela later died in a car inferno while chasing Luisa.</p><p><strong>5. The secrets!</strong></p><p>Even Salvador’s secret inhas got nothing on the kind of suspense and secrets that “Gardener’s Daughter” offered. From Luisa Fernanda not knowing that Luis Alejandro was her father, to her not knowing that the mansion where she worked in as a maid actually belonged to her. Everyone’s life was just intertwined. Let’s not even talk about the fact that she was dating her ‘step brother.’</p><p>What do you remember about the series?
