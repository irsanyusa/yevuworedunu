Sir Scratchy! Suddenly, you hear loud stomping. The dishes on&nbsp;the dinner table clink with every thump. A&nbsp;painting’s fallen off the wall!

No, Scratchy, stop rolling, you’ll turn over the cupboard! Well, this is&nbsp;one possible scenario for the evolution of&nbsp;<a href=# title=animals data-link=tag>animals</a> in&nbsp;the future. Climate, <a href=# title=water data-link=tag>water</a>, oxygen in&nbsp;the air, and even gravity are factors that influence the course of&nbsp;evolution.</p><p>For example, scientists predict that some bird species will gradually lose their warm feathers. In&nbsp;the future, they will basically look like sphinx cats with beaks and <a href=# title=wings data-link=tag>wings</a>. The same thing might happen to&nbsp;our pets. Gradually, their fur will become shorter until they’re completely bald.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/06f/981/c0172f57c9ad1f988d18f3cf62.png><p>Urban pests like pigeons and rats will become even bigger, the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;cat. A&nbsp;few million years ago, rats were barely the size of&nbsp;your little finger. That’s because they hid in&nbsp;small burrows, and had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;nearly invisible to&nbsp;large predators. Now, they live in&nbsp;comfortable cellars that humans have built. They can create cozy nests there. And the large amount of&nbsp;food in&nbsp;trash cans keeps them from starving. So&nbsp;they feel quite comfortable and continue to&nbsp;grow in&nbsp;size. Even more, rats have already developed oily fur so&nbsp;that dirty or&nbsp;toxic water can run off them without harming the rodents themselves.</p><p>Plant-eating mammals, on&nbsp;the other hand, might have it&nbsp;worse. Their food will gradually diminish. With time, there will be&nbsp;fewer forests and greenery on&nbsp;the planet, and some plants will disappear altogether. Eventually, animals like deer, elephants, giraffes, and others will get smaller and smaller because of&nbsp;the lack of&nbsp;food. In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;shrinking, mammals will have smaller eyes, so&nbsp;they don’t lose water from their bodies. And their ears will become larger to&nbsp;lose heat through them. Their tails will grow longer to&nbsp;swat away insects.</p><p>As&nbsp;land mammals become smaller, birds will increase in&nbsp;size. That’s because they’ll be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;include shrinking animals in&nbsp;their diet. And the muscles of&nbsp;birds will become much stronger because they’ll have to&nbsp;fly long distances in&nbsp;search of&nbsp;food. Animals in&nbsp;hot and dry places are more likely to&nbsp;learn how to&nbsp;get water from the air. To&nbsp;do&nbsp;so, they’ll need long “sails” or&nbsp;skin flaps. Early in&nbsp;the morning, when the air is&nbsp;coolest, moisture will accumulate on&nbsp;these new body parts. And some lizards will evolve their collars to&nbsp;a&nbsp;much larger size. Then they’ll be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;collect more rainwater.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f82/5b2/91b5fa55c2aa85c8a2d36d8238.png><p>As&nbsp;for the marine world, we&nbsp;can already see some <a href=# title=fish data-link=tag>fish</a> jumping out of&nbsp;the water to&nbsp;catch insects. In&nbsp;the course of&nbsp;evolution, fish fins may become longer and stronger so&nbsp;that they can leap further. And gradually, those fins will turn into wings to&nbsp;make them truly flying fish. Perhaps in&nbsp;the future, these fish will hunt small birds. To&nbsp;do&nbsp;that, they’ll learn to&nbsp;hold their breath for longer and fly much higher.</p><p>But the big fish and marine mammals will have a&nbsp;hard time. The <a href=# title=ocean data-link=tag>ocean</a> will heat&nbsp;up, and some species will begin to&nbsp;disappear. The largest inhabitant of&nbsp;the aquatic world, the blue whale, which is&nbsp;the size of&nbsp;two school buses, will shrink in&nbsp;size because there will be&nbsp;less food for it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the ocean.</p><p>But the population of&nbsp;lizards and reptiles will thrive. They’re good at&nbsp;absorbing heat. And with climate change, there will be&nbsp;more insects on&nbsp;our planet, which means more food for lizards. They’ll start to&nbsp;increase in&nbsp;size. But now, they’ll have to&nbsp;defend themselves against big birds. Their legs will become longer and stronger. So&nbsp;they’ll be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;run a&nbsp;lot faster and not get eaten by&nbsp;a&nbsp;bird.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/daa/5b1/9e53bc534fad31d96eca6826ee.png><p>And the insects... They’ll just explode. Insects will probably live in&nbsp;huge swarms and fly around looking for food. And they’ll be&nbsp;angry and hungry because their usual source of&nbsp;food, mammals, will have either ceased to&nbsp;exist or&nbsp;shrunk in&nbsp;size.</p><p>Humans will change, too. Scientists predict that between 1,000 and 1&nbsp;million years from now, we&nbsp;will completely lose our hair. Our limbs will become thinner and longer. And we’ll be&nbsp;about [7&nbsp;ft (2.1&nbsp;m)] 7&nbsp;feet tall. Our feet will most likely lose their toes because they’re no&nbsp;longer needed to&nbsp;keep our balance. Our head and <a href=# title=brain data-link=tag>brain</a> will become more like a&nbsp;balloon. And our lifespan will be&nbsp;more than 100&nbsp;years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4b5/2d7/dfb75058b19a97cdd6b9ac8e9d.png><p>Because humans are at&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;the food chain and don’t take part in&nbsp;natural selection, we’ll gradually become similar to&nbsp;each other. In&nbsp;tens of&nbsp;millions of&nbsp;years, all humans will probably look the same. Plus, we’re developing genetic engineering technology. Luminous rabbits, incredibly sized cows, web-weaving goats, super muscular pigs, and more.</p><p>But we’re more interested in&nbsp;how animals will evolve on&nbsp;their own. So&nbsp;fast-forward ahead in&nbsp;time. Humans have long-lived on&nbsp;other planets and in&nbsp;other galaxies. Earth has long since become home only to&nbsp;animals and plants. The only traces of&nbsp;humans here are giant cities made of&nbsp;metal and concrete that are buried deep underground.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f0a/4ef/a3652955f49003e6fd4978b370.png><p>And up&nbsp;there, incredible creatures like the Necropteryx live. It’s something between an&nbsp;ostrich and a&nbsp;vulture the size of&nbsp;an&nbsp;adult human. Its long and powerful beak is&nbsp;its main tool for protection against predators and for eating. Their strong legs with long claws make them excellent runners. This creature can walk dozens of&nbsp;miles in&nbsp;a&nbsp;day. Necropteryx needs warm fur or&nbsp;feathers. Without humans and the greenhouse effect, the temperature on&nbsp;Earth has dropped. But with a&nbsp;warm jacket, they’ll be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;survive even a&nbsp;new ice age. And like ostriches, they reproduce by&nbsp;laying eggs.</p><p>This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;parashrew. It’s like a&nbsp;common shrew a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;inches long. But it&nbsp;has an&nbsp;unusual feature&nbsp;— a&nbsp;parachute on&nbsp;its tail. While little, they live in&nbsp;their parents’ nests. But when they leave them, they launch themselves into the air and then open a&nbsp;parachute made of&nbsp;thin fur. The warm currents of&nbsp;air rise up&nbsp;and carry them. They can spend up&nbsp;to&nbsp;24&nbsp;hours in&nbsp;the air. Then, they’ll nest elsewhere, and their babies will leave their home the same way.</p><p>Wakka. This animal looks like a&nbsp;striped giraffe with only two legs. It’ll be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the fastest creatures on&nbsp;our planet. No&nbsp;predator can beat it&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;race. Plus, their eyes are perched high on&nbsp;their head. And with its long neck, the Wakka can see a&nbsp;threat even when sitting in&nbsp;tall grass.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/61a/e0f/b3183f57b3842e0d8711f8c53e.png><p>Terabytes are descendants of&nbsp;termites that will appear on&nbsp;Earth in&nbsp;200 million years. If&nbsp;they see a&nbsp;threat, they’ll spew a&nbsp;stream of&nbsp;chemicals, something like acid, from their huge head. Even the biggest predators will be&nbsp;afraid to&nbsp;approach them.</p><p>Reedstilts are about [3.5&nbsp;ft (1&nbsp;m)] 3.5 feet tall and weigh almost as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;an&nbsp;adult human. Thanks to&nbsp;its striped coloring, a&nbsp;Reedstilt is&nbsp;almost invisible in&nbsp;the reeds. It&nbsp;walks on&nbsp;its thin legs through marshy terrain and feeds on&nbsp;small fish. Its long neck and sharp teeth allow it&nbsp;to&nbsp;dash into the water almost cobra-like. It&nbsp;catches fish and swallows them almost whole.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/123/a16/f066065726841f8d2899e741a5.png><p>But all of&nbsp;these predictions are very speculative. There are billions of&nbsp;factors that influence the course of&nbsp;evolution. The course of&nbsp;evolution could go&nbsp;the other way at&nbsp;any time.</p><p>For example, an&nbsp;asteroid hits the Earth, causing a&nbsp;mass extinction and changing our planet’s climate. A&nbsp;small percentage of&nbsp;surviving organisms begin to&nbsp;adapt to&nbsp;the new conditions. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;few million years, we’ll have animals that none of&nbsp;us could have even imagined.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSprdNmmKehnZa5tHnOp2SemaKptW7DyKWjZqSfpLhuuMiknGahnmKubrnIpaOip55ixqat0axkcWljboB0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
