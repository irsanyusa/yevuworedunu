"[Kellyanne] is great person and frankly his actions are horrible."</p><p>George Conway has been <a href=# id=5f33ed06-0f6d-3799-a03e-57053ab9e675>described</a> by some as "America's favorite tweeting lawyer" and has routinely tweeted messages that broadly conflict with the Trump administration's agenda.</p><p>"That the President doesn't necessarily know what he's talking about or isn't necessarily telling the truth obviously *has* to be the government's position, because, well, facts are facts," Conway <a href=# id=ff53a6af-2ac8-332a-af46-9c3ce27f33ea>tweeted</a> on Friday, referring to a court filing from the Justice Department on the veracity of Trump's tweets.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Conway, who previously identified as a Republican, said he was unsure about the direction the GOP is heading towards during the Trump administration.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-8cf3d8f4-7926-3046-a6c6-02206e5efba7 data-caption="George Conway"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/eTDktktTURBXy82Y2Y3M2UwZS0wOTNhLTQwNmQtYTQwYS02ZjBhMjczMmY1ZDIucG5nkZUCzQMWzQJRwsM></span><p>"I don't feel comfortable being a Republican anymore," Conway said in a <a href=# id=41ada971-a475-3c61-ac75-5c0ba1eac2c8>podcast</a> in November. "I think the Republican Party has become something of a personality cult."</p><p>"I'm watching this thing, and it's like the administration is like a s---show in a dumpster fire," Conway added. "And I'm like, 'I don't want to do that. I don't know.'"</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>As a front-runner candidate to lead the Justice Department's civil division during Trump's presidency, Conway reportedly declined the offer in 2017 and has since been billed as an agitator of the Trump White House — where his wife can be seen fiercely defending the president amid an avalanche of unflattering news.</p><p>Eric is not the only Trump to have publicly slammed Conway. The president appears to be aware of some of Conway's criticism, many of which are publicly available on Twitter, where his nearly 180,000 followers can view legal analyses and pictures of <a href=# id=a968766f-495e-3211-a988-1e59b1c1742f>corgis</a> .</p><p>"You mean, Mr. Kellyanne Conway?" the president said to reporters in November, after Conway criticized his appointment of acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker. "He's trying to get publicity for himself."</p><p>"Why don't you do this: why don't you ask Kellyanne that question, alright?" he continued. "She might know him better than me. I really don't know the guy."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO: <span id=cc66e4d1-fd7f-3d83-a486-5ddd99a54a56>'A s---show in a dumpster fire': Attorney George Conway, husband of Kellyanne Conway, rails against the Trump administration</span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7z6ijoqyZmMBws8SoqaCdXZi8r8PAsqpmmZOptrC60maYq51dnbyzvsibo55llae2pHnTq6ymqF2cvKa%2FjKidn2WRnK6qutKtZKSdnKHGorrNnmScp56srrq%2FjpuoqW2cZbM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
