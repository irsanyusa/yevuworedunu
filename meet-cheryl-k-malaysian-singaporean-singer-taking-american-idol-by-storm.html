She began singing very early on and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>won four gold medals</a> at the World Championship of Performing Arts in Los Angeles when she was just 14 years old. But Cheryl certainly had her big break when Crazy Rich Asians began a casting search for talent online. Cheryl caught director Jon M. Chu’s eye with her video singing Jesse J’s “Mamma Knows Best.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>“The script took up most of the video’s time so I only had 15 seconds to sing an a cappella of Jessie J’s&nbsp;‘Mamma Knows Best.’ Never would I imagine that that would be enough to catch Jon’s eye,” she said in an interview. Cheryl was a student at the University of Southern California at the time when she got the call to come to record the song “Money (That’s What I Want)” for Crazy Rich Asians.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FIRST LOOK AT THE NEW CONTESTANTS ON ‘AMERICAN IDOL’ 2021</a></strong></p><p>“It took about four to five hours to record everything including multiple takes and layers, backup vocals, behind-the-scenes footages and a video interview,” she said. “Jon was so fun to work with in the recording studio! He gave me a lot of pointers and tips on how he wanted me to sing the song. I remember him saying, ‘Cheryl, I want you to growl as much as you can and sing with your greatest energy because I want people to feel like they want to jump out of their seats during the opening of the movie.'”</p><p>Not only is Cheryl’s song featured during the opening of the movie, but during the end credits as well. Awkwafina who stars in the film recorded a rap verse for the song. The pair posed for a photo together posted on Cheryl’s Instagram account.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B6-fgpmnI2Y/</p></figure><p>Cheryl got to meet the stars of Crazy Rich Asians at the premiere in Los Angeles including The Masked Singer judge Ken Jeong. “It was Ken Jeong who humbly came up to me to introduce himself,” she said.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-is-ready-to-take-her-singing-career-to-the-next-level>She Is Ready To Take Her Singing Career To The Next Level</h3><p>After graduating from college, Cheryl has her sights set on pursuing a career as a full-time singer. “American Idol was the thing that made me want to be a singer,” Cheryl says through tears in the trailer released for the show.
