"I think on that basis it would not be in the public interest to prosecute."</p><p>Freeman admitted, though, that this would not be a given: "They might say, 'We don't care who he is.'"</p><p>"They might think at his age, at his position, he could afford a driver, he's got all the facilities, he shouldnt be risking the lives of others. They might push for prosecution."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>At 97 years of age, the prince's crash has got people wondering whether he ought to turn in his license, but experts have rebuffed claims that elderly drivers are a danger on the roads.</p><p>Robert Jobson, royal editor of the Evening Standard, told <a href=# id=ad67ba1f-b4e9-360d-aae6-7d3321be59e7>Sky News</a> : "It seems rather ridiculous to put, not necessarily himself, but other people at risk.</p><p>"I think there will be some people close to him in the family, suggesting that maybe it's better he's driven.</p><p>"Nobody wants to see a situation like this."</p><p>However, Chris Musselwhite, associate professor at Swansea University's Centre for Innovative Ageing, told Sky News: "We tend to find, as a cohort, we don't think older drivers are any more dangerous than perhaps any other age.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"On the whole, we think the older cohort are pretty safe."</p><p>According to the BBC, drivers aged 17-24 are involved in around four times more traffic accidents than over-70s.</p><p>Edmund King, president of The AA motoring association, echoed these figures when speaking to the Daily Mail.</p><p>"If driving restrictions based on age and safety were introduced, we would be more likely to restrict young drivers rather than older drivers," King said.</p><p>"Older drivers often self-restrict their driving by not driving at night and only driving on familiar roads.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"The decision to hang up your keys is a tough one but should be based on personal advice from your GP (family doctor) and family, rather than being based on some arbitrary age."</p><p>While there is no age limit for driving in the UK, motorists must renew their licence at least 90 days before reaching the age of 70, and then every three years after that.</p><p>Buckingham Palace representatives were unavailable when INSIDER reached out for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7y6Kdnqukrrmme5hwZLKdkad6sLjDZqeroZ6Ysm68x6Kjoqhdna6lecBmqZ6onJawprnEp6tmm5GneqWxy6KtnqqVmXq1tMRmm5qxXZaztbHRZp%2Biq12WsKS1w56lrWeoqLlzudmp</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
