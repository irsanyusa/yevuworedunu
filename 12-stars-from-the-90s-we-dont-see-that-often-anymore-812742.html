Many actors have shifted gears and pursued new passions. While some may have fallen off the radar for a&nbsp;while, they are still making their mark in&nbsp;new areas, or&nbsp;they’ve simply taken on&nbsp;projects that are not as&nbsp;big and successful as&nbsp;the shows they were once popular&nbsp;on. Their career transitions serve as&nbsp;a&nbsp;reminder that it’s never too late to&nbsp;pursue a&nbsp;new passion or&nbsp;embark on&nbsp;a&nbsp;new journey.</p><p><h2>1. Moises Arias</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/58e/801/ee420e519e9bafed52ea3bc914.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Moises Arias</a> may have risen to&nbsp;fame as&nbsp;the lovable Rico on&nbsp;Disney Channel’s hit series, <i>Hannah Montana</i>, but he’s come a&nbsp;long way since then.

Despite his busy schedule, Arias still finds time for his passion, photography. His website, 490tx, features a&nbsp;collection of&nbsp;his stunning work that showcases his skills behind the lens.</p><p><h2>2. Mara Wilson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/89a/04c/05cc3e59a58502f99b47bdc024.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the 1990s, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Mara Wilson</a> was one of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>’s most recognizable child stars. With beloved roles in&nbsp;<strong>films like </strong><a href=#><i><strong>Matilda</strong></i></a><strong>, </strong><i><strong>Miracle on&nbsp;34th Street</strong></i><strong>, and </strong><i><strong>Mrs. Doubtfire</strong></i>, Wilson captured hearts around the world. However, she stepped away from the spotlight at&nbsp;just 13&nbsp;years old after reaching the peak of&nbsp;her success.</p><p>As&nbsp;an&nbsp;adult, Wilson has returned to&nbsp;acting but has opted for less mainstream projects. Today, at&nbsp;36&nbsp;years old, she continues to&nbsp;captivate audiences with her talent and outspoken views on&nbsp;the entertainment industry’s treatment of&nbsp;young performers.</p><p><h2>3. Edward Furlong</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0ea/780/1148e058ba9601b5e1ed9f2523.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Edward Furlong’s</a> Hollywood journey began with his iconic role as&nbsp;John Connor in&nbsp;the <strong>blockbuster hit, </strong><i><strong>Terminator&nbsp;2: Judgment Day</strong></i>. Since then, Furlong has had his ups and downs, but he’s been steadily making a&nbsp;comeback in&nbsp;recent years. After his rehabilitation in&nbsp;2013, Furlong has been landing consistent work, primarily in&nbsp;smaller projects, such as&nbsp;<i>Renegades</i>, a&nbsp;Star Trek fan film, <i>The Reunion</i>, and <i>Awaken</i>.</p><p>However, he&nbsp;has not lost his passion for acting, and his dedication to&nbsp;his craft is&nbsp;evident in&nbsp;his recent projects. Currently, Furlong has 3&nbsp;upcoming projects in&nbsp;production: <i>Charlie’s Horse</i>, <i>Karma</i>, and <i>The</i> <i>Endless Whispers</i>.

Despite his success on&nbsp;the show, <strong>Earles never expected it&nbsp;to&nbsp;become the massive hit</strong> it&nbsp;did when it&nbsp;first premiered in&nbsp;2006. In&nbsp;fact, Earles initially had reservations about his character’s portrayal in&nbsp;the pilot episode, feeling that the original concept was too childish. However, after some changes were made, Jackson became the character fans came to&nbsp;know and love.</p><p>Over a&nbsp;decade later, Earles is&nbsp;returning to&nbsp;his Disney roots in&nbsp;the third season of&nbsp;<i>High School Musical: The Series</i>.

In&nbsp;fact, his last live-action film role was in&nbsp;<i>Honey, We&nbsp;Shrunk Ourselves</i> in&nbsp;1997. But Moranis, who is&nbsp;now 70&nbsp;years old, had a&nbsp;good reason for stepping back from acting as&nbsp;he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;raise his kids alone. And, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;explained in&nbsp;a&nbsp;rare interview, <strong>he&nbsp;would need a&nbsp;compelling reason to&nbsp;return to&nbsp;the big screen.</strong></p><p>Despite his absence from the spotlight, Moranis has remained busy with other projects. He&nbsp;created the animated show, <i>Bob &&nbsp;Doug</i>, based on&nbsp;SCTV characters, and has continued to&nbsp;take on&nbsp;voice roles in&nbsp;films such as&nbsp;<i>Brother Bear</i> and <i>Miss Spider’s Sunny Patch Kids</i>.
