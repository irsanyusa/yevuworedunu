But at just over 75 million units sold, the PSP was still a success by most measures, and in the seven years since its Japanese debut in December 2004, it’s accumulated a catalogue of memorable games (some exclusive, others arguably superior console ports): God of War: Chains of Olympus, Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions, Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together, Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars, Daxter, Jeanne D’Arc and so on."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That’s because the Vita employs two optional techniques when upscaling PSP games to its 5-inch, 960 x 544 pixel OLED screen: bilinear filtering, and something Sony calls “color space.”</p><p>When LCD technology arrived, it came with a hidden price: static pixel resolution. Every LCD-based screen has a native resolution —&nbsp;output something at a resolution lower than the LCD’s native resolution, and the image has to be upscaled, stretching or “interpolating” the pixels. The result tends to be a blurry, slightly mangled image, most noticeable around the edges of objects, say a 2D text box or a 3D character’s body outline.&nbsp;The greater the resolution difference, the greater the visual degradation.</p><p>PSP games run at 480 x 272 pixel resolution, but have to be upscaled to the Vita’s 960 x 544 pixels. What’s more, the Vita has an OLED screen, meaning the way it handles colors is actually different from the PSP’s LCD-based color technology.&nbsp;To remedy the interpolation and color issues with PSP games, the Vita allows you to enable “bilinear filtering” and make color output more like it would be on an LCD screen.</p><p>Bilinear filtering is a fairly common technique used to smooth textures when they’re displayed larger or smaller than their actual size. I’ve seen it enabled in a few games on the Vita, like Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions, and to my eye, Square Enix’s tactical RPG actually looks better, while benefitting from the Vita’s spacious screen real estate. The blur I was expecting is barely discernible, and the game has a cleaner overall look —&nbsp;still detailed, but with its edges smoothed over.</p><p>The benefits of “color space” are less apparent so far — Sony admits the impact of this feature may be hard to determine in some games, and that looks to be the case in Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions — but if you’re after LCD fidelity, at least the option’s available.</p><p>There’s actually one more downside to Vita-PSP gameplay at the outset: Sony isn’t offering the full catalogue of PlayStation Store PSP games for download…well, not yet. They’ve just <a href=#>put up the launch list on the PlayStation blog</a>, and while they’re only offering 275 PSP games at launch, they promise “more PSP titles will be made available for PS Vita play in the coming weeks.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=#>Everything You Need to Know About Sony’s PlayStation Vita Launch</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmislZi1ra3NnWWtoZ2ae6S7zGhpaWliZH1ze5BpZqGnp2LDqsDAZqesqF2crq6xjJympqiRqbajtcuiq7Jlp6S%2FrL%2BMpZiuppOderTBz6mmq6xdoba0wIyarZqhnJavrbGMp6awZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
