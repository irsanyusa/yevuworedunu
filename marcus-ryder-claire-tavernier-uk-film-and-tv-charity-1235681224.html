It is recognised throughout the sector for making a significant contribution to the health and happiness of people working across the industry, and to its future sustainability, and I have admired how, through its research work, it has done much to shape the debate about how we treat the brilliant people who form the bedrock of the U.K.’s creative sector. The organization and I also share a deep-seated understanding that the Charity will only be able to fulfil its core aims if it helps the industry address issues of equality, diversity and inclusion. I cannot wait to get to work to shape and implement a shared, ambitious strategy to make further strides across all of these priorities.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Tavernier added: “I have watched with admiration as the organization has tackled some of the industry’s most complex issues and constantly learnt and adapted in an ever-changing environment. There is still much more to be done, and the charity has an ambitious strategy to further the support it offers the industry. I am looking forward to working with the trustees and the charity’s brilliant team to continue their exceptional work. I’m also thrilled to welcome Marcus as our new CEO and work together as we prepare for our centenary year. I want to express my gratitude to the team at the Lenny Henry Centre for their grace and warmth during this transition.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV9nfXN%2Fjpugs2eXobyjrctopJqqk6rAbr7YnZyrZZOhrqq%2BxGarmq6Vp7uqsdFmrKRllp65rnnAp5tmrKZisKmt0aKrsmVhZ4B2gpdqaWtsXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
