For example, there was a script that I had and it was supposed to be emotional and I said, ‘Okay can I be emotional without crying?’ I didn't shed a tear in that film. There are other ways you could be emotional without shedding tears’”</p><p>He spoke about how difficult an audition can be, and he placed the blame on the casting directors, saying, “Auditions challenge you. One of the worst things is getting a ‘No’ or getting in front of some people and losing all your lines and whatever, that is also because of most of our casting directors here.”</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-996ae8e8-7e81-46b6-9f61-8beeed3b7969 data-caption="Chimezie Imo with his Trailblazer award at the 2024 AMVCA [Africa Magic]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/3kmktkpTURBXy8wZDEwZjI2ODgwODk1ODNhZGZiMGJlZjg4ZGRmODJlZi5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAr3Cww></span> <span class=caption>Chimezie Imo with his Trailblazer award at the 2024 AMVCA [Africa Magic]</span> <span class=copyright>Pulse Nigeria</span><p>Imo also emphasised the lack of warmth in some audition environments and acknowledged the pressure actors face, saying, “I think we also need to do better. We don't know how to make people comfortable and warm, just a bunch of straight faces looking at you like they're about to stab you, and that line you've been rehearsing for 3 weeks just flies.”</p><p>See the interview below:</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6mpq%2Bhlah8qsDSZqWorF2nsqK4y7JkmmWSlrFuwMeipaBlk522rrHZopxmoZ2kerC6jJqaraeiqHqxuMCyoKefXajBpr7EqKuyqJWofKS3xrCwpKY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
