Mad Dog has posters on the wall, a collection of books on a desk, a record player, and even a pull-up bar in his cell. When Archie tries to introduce himself to Mad Dog, he merely looks over at him and doesn't respond. His only words to Archie are a warning about keeping his nice shoes laced tight.</p><p>But as soon as Mad Dog is introduced, he mysteriously disappears, creating another mystery to solve.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Here's what we know about Mad Dog so far.</p><p>Initially quiet when he first meets Archie, Mad Dog later opens up when Archie asks him to play in the football game with them.</p><p>Mad Dog tells him he can't because the warden says he "has other business." When Archie presses him on what he's doing, he starts talking about his family.</p><p>"Before this place, I had a mom, a little brother, girl too, Liz," he says. "They used to come visit me every Saturday. One day the warden tells me I can't see them anymore. They've been banned. 'It's for my own good,' he said. That was two years ago."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>He reveals that he is supposed to be transferred to a real prison the following month to spend 20 years serving time.</p><p>But he doesn't go into any other details about what he is in juvie for.</p><p>"Riverdale" airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET on The CW.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7y6Kdnqukrrmme8uinZ6rpK65pnnEr5yrsaSdtq%2BzjLCcZqOepMRurcGorK1lkaewqbXErGScnZyhuqLAxGakmpxdmbyoec6nZKuhppq%2Fpa3LnmafcaRps6ax</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
