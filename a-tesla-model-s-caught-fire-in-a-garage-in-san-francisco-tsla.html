Tesla said on its Weibo account that it was investigating the incident.</p><p>You can read Tesla's full statement about Friday's incident below:</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Tesla cars are approximately 10 times less likely to experience a fire than gas cars, which are involved in about 200,000 cases of fire per year in North America and well over one million worldwide. Based on our work investigating the causes of car fires, we know that there are many external factors that can cause a fire to occur, including building fires, vehicle damage, improper maintenance by unauthorized mechanics, aftermarket modifications, improper vehicle charging, and even arson. In this instance, we have not received any information to indicate that this fire was a result of any issues with the car itself. Still, we believe that even a factor of ten fewer fires per vehicle for electric cars is too many, and we aspire to be as close to zero as we can. We are always learning from our fleet and constantly evaluate whether there are over-the-air updates we can deploy to make our cars even safer than they already are.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO: <span id=4da65542-f740-3f42-af61-c1af776eb759>Tesla's infotainment system is better than any other auto brand's, according to Consumer Reports</span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7y6Kdnqukrrmme8Bmq56rnJZ6rrvDnqNmq12Yrrazx61kn6GimnqquoyaZKCZopa0pnnIp2SsmZ5is7OtzZygrJufYsG0uMBomWxtaZzBeA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
