MAPS Public Benefit Corp., a company that develops prescription psychedelics, said it would submit the trial results to the Food and Drug Administration for approval later this year, a significant step in what has been a long and complicated journey for the drugs to be considered legitimate mental health treatments."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, there is a stark generational divide among those who are interested, with millennials expressing the most curiosity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Consumers are willing to try new psychedelic treatments after research into the area has been <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>limited</a> for decades. The federal government and medical community have recently been more accepting of testing these drugs as treatment options for certain mental health conditions, typically in combination with therapy.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">For example, the FDA <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>issued</a> its first draft guidance for clinical trials that use psychedelic drugs in June, and the Department of Veterans Affairs <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>released</a> study results in October 2022 that found that MDMA in combination with psychotherapy may improve PTSD symptoms and that psilocybin, the naturally occurring compound in “magic mushrooms,” combined with therapy may reduce depressive symptoms, among other findings.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Medical schools are also <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>studying</a> whether psilocybin can be an effective treatment for major depressive disorder and other mental illnesses. However, there are still <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>questions</a> about the efficacy of certain treatments, such as whether the drugs are actually benefiting patients or whether there is a placebo effect that is influencing trial results.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While there has been stigma and criminality attached to many of these drugs for 50 or 60 years — which could explain the dramatic generational difference in interest — the reality of psychedelics as a legitimate treatment option is gaining momentum.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>The public is more likely to back other measures to increase mental health care than research into psychedelics</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Psychedelics are becoming more accepted at a time when <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>the stigma of treating mental health conditions</a> with traditional treatments is still affecting patients and even keeping some from getting therapy or other services that they desperately need.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">More work needs to be done to remove barriers in the health system that are keeping people from getting care and burdening those who do.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Among U.S. adults, 55% said the federal government should prioritize research into the effectiveness of psychedelics for mental health conditions, while nearly 1 in 3 said they do not think the federal government should prioritize this research.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While the majority said research into psychedelics should be prioritized, there were multiple other measures that address mental health treatments and access that the public thinks should receive more attention. At least 3 in 4 adults said the federal government should prioritize other strategies, such as measures that would reduce the cost of mental health services, expand insurance coverage and research the causes and impact of mental illness.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While there are generational differences among those who would try psychedelics to treat their mental health, there is still a meaningful number of people who are interested, implying that the medical community and federal government should continue to do more research into the use of the drugs as quality treatment options.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX5i8r7%2FUppyrZZmjwaa%2BxKyrZqijrrCpscOeo6Kbo2K6prrTmqNmoJWWubW0</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
