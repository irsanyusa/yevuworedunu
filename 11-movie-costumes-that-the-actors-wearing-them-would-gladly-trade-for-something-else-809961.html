Angelina Jolie — Lara Croft’s costume
Angelina Jolie didn’t really enjoy her costume for Tomb Raider because it was too tight. Also, to look like the main heroine of the computer game of the same name, the actress had to wear padded prosthetics to increase her breast size."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Also, he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;feeling that the costume designers made it&nbsp;heavier every following year. Harington also mentioned that it&nbsp;smelled awful.</p><p><h2>Emilia Clarke&nbsp;— Daenerys’s costumes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a44/3fc/5df522541f9ed2926af61859b5.jpg><p>The other <i>Game of&nbsp;Thrones</i> star believes that her male colleagues were lucky because their costumes were better than the female ones. Some scenes were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>filmed</a> in&nbsp;hotter climates, and male costumes had a&nbsp;special cooling system inside. Unfortunately, women didn’t get this relief. <a href=# title="Emilia Clarke" data-link=tag>Emilia Clarke</a>, for example, was only allowed to&nbsp;have her wig lifted&nbsp;up.</p><p><h2>Ryan Reynolds&nbsp;— Green Lantern’s costume</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/de5/b45/77480a51cfaa5a3b3ad478e52d.jpg><p>This superhero costume was fully <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>created</a> with the help of&nbsp;computer graphics. The actor had to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;special motion picture suit that was later transformed into Green Lantern’s costume during the post-production stage. <a href=# title="Ryan Reynolds" data-link=tag>Ryan Reynolds</a> revealed that the suit was so&nbsp;uncomfortable that he&nbsp;would rather wear a&nbsp;real superhero suit.</p><p>The movie was a&nbsp;box office flop, and many people mentioned that the superhero looked pretty <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>unconvincing</a>. Reynolds said that he&nbsp;didn’t even know what Green Lantern’s suit was supposed to&nbsp;look like and saw it&nbsp;only in&nbsp;the first trailer for the movie.</p><p><h2>Carrie Fisher&nbsp;— Princess Leia’s costume</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/912/74c/4b1da75f49882434699d72d4a2.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the movie, <i>Star Wars: Episode VI&nbsp;— Return of&nbsp;the Jedi</i>, Princess Leia was captured and imprisoned by&nbsp;Jabba the Hutt. And during her imprisonment, she had to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;very revealing costume, a&nbsp;metallic bikini. Carrie Fisher herself <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that this costume would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;curse, even for supermodels. She had to&nbsp;sit very straight because she couldn’t have lines on&nbsp;her sides.</p><p>In&nbsp;general, Fisher believed that such clothes objectified a&nbsp;woman, but she didn’t have much of&nbsp;a&nbsp;choice. She also recommended to&nbsp;the actresses who acted in&nbsp;the latest episodes of&nbsp;<i>Star Wars</i> to&nbsp;fight for their right not to&nbsp;wear such outfits.</p><p><h2>Benedict Cumberbatch&nbsp;— Sherlock Holmes’ costumes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/884/fc1/c2cd1f5fc5808367085a4ae0a3.jpg><p>The actor who played this brilliant detective revealed that he&nbsp;wasn’t fond of&nbsp;Sherlock’s costumes. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that even though the outfits were well-tailored, the waist was way too small. This is&nbsp;why he&nbsp;felt uncomfortable on&nbsp;set and couldn’t breathe or&nbsp;digest properly.</p><p><a href=# title="Benedict Cumberbatch" data-link=tag>Benedict Cumberbatch</a> was also concerned that he&nbsp;couldn’t wear some of&nbsp;his favorite clothes anymore. The fact is&nbsp;that some of&nbsp;them looked very much like the detective’s garments, and people began to&nbsp;associate the actor with his character.</p><p><h2>Margot Robbie&nbsp;— Harley Quinn’s costume</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1f4/e75/bcf76b5a90a7b99999e73f10f8.jpg><p>The style of&nbsp;this supervillain became iconic, mostly thanks to&nbsp;her costume, which consisted of&nbsp;a&nbsp;ripped white T-shirt, short sparkly shorts, and fishnet tights. But the actress wasn’t really <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fond</a> of&nbsp;this costume.</p><p><a href=# title="Margot Robbie" data-link=tag>Margot Robbie</a> said that during the scene where she was hosed down and soaked wet in&nbsp;a&nbsp;white T-shirt, it&nbsp;became so&nbsp;clingy, she felt self-conscious about&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>Elizabeth Olsen&nbsp;— Scarlet Witch’s costume</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/303/eaf/578d88520bb40786324fa5bc08.jpg><p>Elizabeth Olsen once noticed that in&nbsp;<i>Avengers</i>, only her character’s costume had <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cleavage</a>. Other actresses were more covered, and she also wanted her chest to&nbsp;be&nbsp;covered&nbsp;up.</p><p>But she understands that this is&nbsp;just an&nbsp;iconic image that is&nbsp;rooted in&nbsp;comics, and it&nbsp;doesn’t represent the average woman.</p><p><h2>Chris Hemsworth&nbsp;— Thor’s costume<br></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f1c/ec2/c47b6851d9b7ddf86784a471c3.jpg><p>The armor of&nbsp;the Norse god looked terrific but was uncomfortable. The actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> that after a&nbsp;few months of&nbsp;filming, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;pretty difficult thing for him to&nbsp;wake up&nbsp;and put the outfit on&nbsp;every morning.</p><p>At&nbsp;some point, <a href=# title="Chris Hemsworth" data-link=tag>Chris Hemsworth</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bulked up</a>&nbsp;so&nbsp;much that he&nbsp;couldn’t fit into his costume anymore. His hands would start going numb because the sleeves were so&nbsp;tight. Luckily, costume designers altered the outfit, and Hemsworth was able to&nbsp;continue his work on&nbsp;the movie.</p><p><h2>Alyssa Milano&nbsp;— Phoebe’s costumes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/40d/6c1/ecaa2658959d274f87f5813af8.jpg><p>The main characters of&nbsp;<i>Charmed</i> changed multiple costumes throughout the series. But according to&nbsp;Alyssa Milano, many of&nbsp;them were too revealing. In&nbsp;80% of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>scenes</a>, they were dressed in&nbsp;something that looked like underwear. But even&nbsp;so, Alyssa Milano loved the series and its characters.</p><p>By&nbsp;the way, the producer of&nbsp;the show <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confirmed</a> that the television company required them to&nbsp;have more revealing looks on-screen.</p><p><h2>Tom Holland&nbsp;— Spider-Man’s costume<br></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/856/318/5cf91e5c70b970a5c91518772d.jpg><p>Tom Holland <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview that his costume was made from very coarse material, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;thong and a&nbsp;mesh underlay suit underneath to&nbsp;protect his skin. Also, the outfit had hidden zippers that no&nbsp;one could ever find, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;was really difficult to&nbsp;take off.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you think movie costumes should be&nbsp;comfortable, or&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;character’s overall look more important?</p><p>Angelina Jolie has been a&nbsp;<a href=#>beacon of&nbsp;inspiration</a>, not just for her cinematic achievements but also for her personal journey and values. Here’s a&nbsp;glimpse into her world: Angelina Jolie has taken a&nbsp;bold stance against societal pressures on&nbsp;women’s bodies, emphasizing the importance of&nbsp;self-acceptance and challenging beauty norms.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5yecyoraKdXZi8tMDUppysZaSdrrV506GcZpmTqbyzv4ywnJqqmaO0bsDHnqRmr5%2BquaV5xqWYnaSpYsGzrcOeZJ%2BnomLAsLnErZ%2Bippdisq2%2FxGZvaXFpa35w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
