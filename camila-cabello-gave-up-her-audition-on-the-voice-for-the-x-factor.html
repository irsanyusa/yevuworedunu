According to her, she went past the round with NBC producers at the time by singing “Respect” by Aretha Franklin.</p><p>“I did make it in the producer round, not the TV round,” she told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Access</a>. “I never auditioned for the coaches.”</p><p>Apparently, she decided to abandon the possibility of fame on The Voice and chase her dream through The X Factor. The singer admitted that her reason for ditching The Voice was because she was a die-hard fangirl of One Direction and was “in love” with Harry Styles as a teenager.</p><p>“I really wanted to meet One Direction, and I knew that they were gonna perform for X Factor. So I was like, ‘I’m just gonna risk it and not do The Voice and audition for X Factor,'” she said.</p><p>While she joined the US version of The X Factor, her gut assured that she would eventually meet the boy band, who came from the series’ UK edition. Luckily, she ended up meeting One Direction during the Live Shows.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She Would Not Pick Blake Shelton If She Continued Her Audition</h2><p>Cabello initially revealed this information ahead of The Voice season 22 premiere. This elicited a surprised reaction from her fellow coaches.</p><p>Had she made it through the Blinds, she said that she would’ve chosen Adam Levine or Christina Aguilera. Cabello has always been drawn to pop and R&B, so that explains her decision.</p><p>“You don’t think of me when you think of pop?” Blake Shelton jokingly asked.</p><p>Cabello was quick to tease Shelton, saying that he only wants to stay in his country box. On leaving The Voice for One Direction, she admitted that it was a “pretty wild move.”</p><p>Nevertheless, fame may have been really meant for the singer. During her stint in The X Factor, she became a member of Fifth Harmony, a girl band that finished third place in the series. Now, she’s back in The Voice as coach to train aspiring singers alongside seasoned artists like John Legend, Gwen Stefani, and Blake Shelton.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/prove-simon-wrong.jpg alt="10 ‘Got Talent’ Singers Who Proved Simon Cowell Wrong" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>camila cabello</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wpqkoqSRYrCirsSlo6hll5bDpnnUqWShnaJirrawyK2gqKZdpLtuwMeeZK%2BnmZiybrLOq2StoJVixW6ywJyrqKpf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
