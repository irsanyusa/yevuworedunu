The job required Reynolds to sing, dance, and keep up with both Donald O’Connor and the legendary Gene Kelly. It was the part of a lifetime that could shoot her in to super-stardom. There was just one small hurdle—she had almost no experience singing or dancing.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That small detail didn’t stop <a href=#>Reynolds</a> from signing on to the film. “To dance with Gene Kelly and Donald O’Connor in three months—well, anyone else should’ve passed out,” Reynolds <a href=# rel=noopener>told the American Film Institute</a> in 2012. “But I didn’t. I just thought, ‘well, let’s get started.’”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While Kelly was unimpressed by the casting choice, Reynolds proved him wrong, as can be seen in this clip from the film. Turns out she may have had a little help from another dance legend—Fred Astaire, who found Reynolds crying under a piano and helped her practice, according to this <a href=# rel=noopener>charming anecdote in Fox News</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Reynolds was not only able to keep up with Kelly and O’Connor, but danced until her feet were bloody—literally, according to an interview in the UK’s <a href=# rel=noopener>Sunday Express</a> —and then danced some more.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In retrospect, <a href=#>Reynolds</a> knew that she had been naïve to take the role with so little experience. “I was so dumb,” she told AFI. “I didn’t feel you could fail. I felt [the part] was me, and I marched straight ahead.” As can be seen in the clip from Singin’ in the Rain, she resoundingly succeeded. May we all be so “dumb.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtbmFugXiDjp2cm5qZmnqzsdinpqWco2K0prrEZqKepJyuerS1zaCgp2WZo3q1tMRmqZqhnmQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
