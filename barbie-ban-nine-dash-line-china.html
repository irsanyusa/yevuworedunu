But with just weeks before the star-studded film about the titular doll was set to hit theaters, some in Southeast Asia have decided that it’s not for them.
It was announced in Vietnam on Monday that the cinematic distribution of Barbie would be banned over the display of a map that includes the “nine-dash line,” a disputed maritime border that China has controversially used to lay claim to virtually all of the South China Sea, even though it was rejected in 2016 by an international tribunal."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

At the minimum, our cinemas should include an explicit disclaimer that the nine-dash line is a figment of China’s imagination,” Philippine Senator Risa Hontiveros <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a> Tuesday.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">More from TIME</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The context of the alleged depiction of the nine-dash line in the new Barbie movie <a href=# rel=noopener>is unclear</a>. But it’s not the first time this kind of censorship has occurred over similar concerns.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Last year, the <a href=# rel=noopener>Philippines</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Vietnam</a> both banned screenings of Sony’s action-adventure flick <i>Uncharted</i> because of a brief scene depicting the contentious nine-dash line. And in 2019, both the <a href=# rel=noopener>Philippines</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Malaysia</a>—another country that contests China’s territorial claims to the waterway—stopped the domestic distribution of the DreamWorks animated movie <i>Abominable</i> after producers declined a request to remove a scene showing the nine-dash line. (In Vietnam, <i>Abominable</i> had already been out in cinemas for more than a week before censors <a href=# rel=noopener>pulled it</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>fined the film’s distributor</a>.) In 2018, a second-long clip, which featured a designer handbag with a map that showed the South China Sea’s islands under China’s control, <a href=# rel=noopener>was cut</a> from <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i> screenings in Vietnam.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s not just the big screen that’s under scrutiny. In 2021, officials in the Philippines <a href=# rel=noopener>ordered Netflix</a> to take down select episodes of Australian spy drama Pine Gap due to scenes containing the nine-dash line, while Vietnam demanded the <a href=# rel=noopener>entire series be removed</a> from the streamer.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The repeated instances of the same issue raise questions about Hollywood’s relationship with China, which commands a 1.4 billion-person market. China <a href=# rel=noopener>has been critical</a> to the global box office success of many contemporary films, and studios <a href=# rel=noopener>have been known</a> to <a href=# rel=noopener>try to appease</a> Beijing’s own stringent censors in an effort <a href=# rel=noopener>to not be shut out</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Recently, however, Hollywood studios, facing pushback for their acquiescence, have <a href=# rel=noopener>started to stand up to China</a>. The trailer from Tom Cruise’s 2022 movie <i>Top Gun: Maverick</i> initially removed Taiwanese and Japanese flags to placate China, but following a public backlash, the <a href=# rel=noopener>flags reappeared</a> in the film.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A U.S. Defense Department memo obtained by <a href=# rel=noopener>POLITICO</a> last week said that filmmakers won’t receive support from the Pentagon—which <a href=# rel=noopener>typically assists</a> on movies and shows that portray the military or require filming on bases—if they alter their productions to comply with Chinese censorship demands.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The growing resistance from Southeast Asian states to even blink-and-you’ll-miss-it flashes of subtle political messaging in popular culture demonstrates a heightened vigilance against Chinese encroachment, says Richard Heydarian, a political analyst and senior lecturer in Asian affairs at the University of the Philippines. Outright bans come at a price: viewers excited to see much anticipated Hollywood blockbusters miss out, and it thrusts the censoring countries into the spotlight for what Heydarian says could be perceived as “petty oversensitivity.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But getting attention is the point. “Sunlight is the best disinfectant,” Heydarian says. “Vietnam is reminding the world that Chinese state propaganda should have no place in supposedly innocuous productions like <i>Barbie</i> movies. It just doesn’t make sense.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamlnfXeCjpuYq5qZmnqjrc1mpaKmlWKxor%2FHZqOippVisKm1zZpm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
