But in&nbsp;reality, you can turn your life around and feel healthier simply by&nbsp;incorporating a&nbsp;few new habits into your daily routine. For example, you can whiten your teeth using fruit and enjoy an&nbsp;extra cup of&nbsp;hot coffee for a&nbsp;healthy gallbladder. In&nbsp;this article, we’ll show you how many natural and affordable ways there are out there to&nbsp;treat yourself.</p><p>The<strong> Bright Sid</strong>e team presents to&nbsp;you a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;effortless life hacks to&nbsp;treat your body right and give yourself some love.</p><p><h2>1. Try grape juice to&nbsp;heal your migraines.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f04/cb6/cf6c4259d5b40afffd3f748e63.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you suffer from migraines and are looking for a&nbsp;more natural way to&nbsp;stop the insufferable pain, then grape juice is&nbsp;the answer. Since migraines mainly come from an&nbsp;imbalance in&nbsp;brain chemicals such as&nbsp;<a href=# title=serotonin data-link=tag>serotonin</a>, grape juice can come in&nbsp;and save the day. It&nbsp;will not act as&nbsp;a&nbsp;painkiller but as&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>preventative</a>. So&nbsp;the minute you feel a&nbsp;migraine coming&nbsp;on, take some grape juice to&nbsp;prevent&nbsp;it.</p><p>Since grapes are rich in&nbsp;vitamin&nbsp;C, vitamin&nbsp;A, and vitamin&nbsp;B2, they can help stop you from getting a&nbsp;migraine. Let&nbsp;us break it&nbsp;down for you. Vitamin&nbsp;B2, otherwise known as&nbsp;<a href=#>riboflavin</a> which is&nbsp;responsible for treating migraines,<strong> helps to&nbsp;balance out the chemicals in&nbsp;your brain and acts as&nbsp;an&nbsp;iron antagonist to&nbsp;reduce the iron levels in&nbsp;your blood</strong> that might be&nbsp;causing migraines.</p><p><h2>2. Eat salmon to&nbsp;help your hair grow out shiny and healthy.</h2></p><p>Healthy looking hair is&nbsp;something that all of&nbsp;us dream&nbsp;of, especially those mornings when we&nbsp;wake&nbsp;up, look in&nbsp;the mirror, and wonder how our bad hair days far outnumber the good ones. <strong>The thing&nbsp;is, it’s not just what you put on&nbsp;the ends of&nbsp;your hair, but also what you eat. The key trick here is&nbsp;<a href=#>salmon</a>.</strong> Salmon is&nbsp;rich in&nbsp;vitamin&nbsp;D and omega-3 fatty acids which are essential to&nbsp;keep your hair and scalp hydrated.</p><p>In&nbsp;addition, omega-3 lubricates the scalp and keeps hair follicles clean and healthy. Since omega-3&nbsp;is really a&nbsp;protein, a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;it<a href=#>&nbsp;prevents</a> the normal pace of&nbsp;hair growth. So&nbsp;the more salmon you eat, the healthier you and your hair will&nbsp;be. In&nbsp;addition, <strong>due to&nbsp;its moisturizing effects, omega-3 reduces inflammation, helps treat dandruff, and reduces dryness</strong> which all contribute to&nbsp;hair breakage.</p><p><h2>3. You can shed extra pounds by&nbsp;drinking lemon + salt water.</h2></p><p>It’s a&nbsp;known fact that lemon water in&nbsp;is&nbsp;healthy for you, but most of&nbsp;the time it’s just not as&nbsp;tasty as&nbsp;a&nbsp;glass of&nbsp;orange juice or&nbsp;even an&nbsp;energy drink. <strong>Lemon and salt are the 2&nbsp;magic ingredients that help flush out toxins from your body and help shed extra pounds quite fast.</strong> <a href=#>This is&nbsp;because</a> it&nbsp;increases your bowel movements and decreases your appetite, thus eliminating excess calorie intake.</p><p>Lemon and salt water can also <a href=#>speed up&nbsp;your metabolism</a> and there’s even research to&nbsp;back this&nbsp;up. According to&nbsp;the National Institute of&nbsp;Health, <strong>drinking plenty of&nbsp;water increases your <a href=# title=metabolism data-link=tag>metabolism</a> by&nbsp;increasing the mitochondrial function (which helps to&nbsp;generate more energy in&nbsp;the body without needing any calories to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so) </strong>and generates thermogenesis (the metabolic process where calories are burned faster to&nbsp;produce heat).</p><p><h2>4. Whiten your nails using toothpaste.</h2></p><p>Experiencing some yellowing around and on&nbsp;your nails is&nbsp;absolutely natural, but sometimes it’s not a&nbsp;good look. So&nbsp;if&nbsp;you’re looking for a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;naturally whiten your nails, <a href=# title=toothpaste data-link=tag>toothpaste</a> is&nbsp;the answer. <strong>Not only does toothpaste whiten and protect your teeth, but it&nbsp;also does the same for your nails since they are <a href=#>both keratin</a> based</strong>.</p><ul><li>For this hack, simply take a&nbsp;clean toothbrush, apply some toothpaste on&nbsp;the tip of&nbsp;it, and start to&nbsp;lightly scrub/brush your nails with&nbsp;it. Let it&nbsp;sit there for a&nbsp;minute, wash your hands as&nbsp;usual, and voilá!</li></ul><p><h2>5. Stimulate hair growth by&nbsp;creating your own hair growth serum.</h2></p><p>As&nbsp;we&nbsp;mentioned above, diet is&nbsp;key when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;faster and healthier hair growth, but for those of&nbsp;you who would like to&nbsp;go&nbsp;a&nbsp;step further, we’ll show you how to&nbsp;create your own hair growth serum. The first ingredient you’ll need is&nbsp;<a href=#>castor oil</a>. It&nbsp;contains important nutrients such as&nbsp;vitamin&nbsp;E to&nbsp;moisturize your scalp, omega-9, and omega-6 fatty acids, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;<strong>minerals that will help moisturize and penetrate your scalp.</strong></p><p>The second one is&nbsp;<a href=#>avocado oil</a> which is&nbsp;rich in&nbsp;vitamins and minerals <strong>such as&nbsp;oleic acid, which is&nbsp;a&nbsp;monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid that can help nourish your hair and protect it&nbsp;from breaking</strong>. It’s the only oil that has the ability to&nbsp;penetrate the hair shaft and moisturize it&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;just sitting on&nbsp;your hair and acting as&nbsp;an&nbsp;oily layer.</p><p>The final ingredient is&nbsp;<a href=#>coconut oil</a>, which is&nbsp;considered the king of&nbsp;all oils for many different reasons. To&nbsp;begin with, <strong><a href=# title="coconut oil" data-link=tag>coconut oil</a> is&nbsp;the only oil that you can apply on&nbsp;your hair and prevent it&nbsp;from losing protein.</strong> Since it’s rich in&nbsp;omega-3, omega-6, and omega-9 fatty acids, it&nbsp;also protects the hair shaft from environmental and sun damage.</p><p><strong>Here’s how you make the mixture:</strong></p><ul><li>Fill a&nbsp;small container with 1/3 castor oil, 1/3 avocado oil, and 1/3 coconut oil.</li><li>Shake the bottle really well.</li><li>Apply it&nbsp;to&nbsp;your scalp and hair and massage it&nbsp;in&nbsp;for 10&nbsp;to&nbsp;15&nbsp;minutes.</li><li>Let it&nbsp;sit there for 30&nbsp;minutes to&nbsp;1&nbsp;hour.</li><li>Shower and then apply some oil to&nbsp;the ends of&nbsp;your hair while it’s still wet.</li><li>Repeat this 3&nbsp;times a&nbsp;week.</li></ul><p><h2>6. Eat your breakfast within the first 30&nbsp;minutes after you wake&nbsp;up.</h2></p><p>Right after you’ve had your lemon and salt water right when you wake&nbsp;up, it’s important to&nbsp;have your breakfast within half an&nbsp;hour after you’ve opened your eyes. Even when you don’t feel hungry, missing your breakfast is&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge mistake especially when you’re trying to&nbsp;lose or&nbsp;maintain weight. According to&nbsp;the <a href=#>National Weight Control Registry</a>, more than&nbsp;70% of&nbsp;people who were on&nbsp;a&nbsp;successful diet ate breakfast within half an&nbsp;hour after waking&nbsp;up.</p><p>This is&nbsp;because your metabolism is&nbsp;relatively slow when you sleep, and it&nbsp;takes an&nbsp;hour for it&nbsp;to&nbsp;start working at&nbsp;a&nbsp;normal pace. So, eating <strong>breakfast before your metabolism is&nbsp;completely awake will make you feel fuller for a&nbsp;longer time and it&nbsp;will prevent you from eating a&nbsp;heavier breakfast</strong> or&nbsp;a&nbsp;bigger meal later in&nbsp;the day.</p><p><h2>7. Drink hydrolyzed collagen instead of&nbsp;applying it&nbsp;to&nbsp;your skin.</h2></p><p>Aging is&nbsp;something that most of&nbsp;us never really come to&nbsp;terms with and it’s often first noticed in&nbsp;your skin’s appearance. We&nbsp;all try to&nbsp;bring our skin “back to&nbsp;life” by&nbsp;purchasing moisturizers, masks, and serums that are rich in&nbsp;collagen (the protein responsible for keeping our skin tight and glowing in&nbsp;our 30s).</p><p>The thing&nbsp;is, collagen, or&nbsp;even hydrolyzed collagen, <strong>doesn’t penetrate the skin to&nbsp;the point where it&nbsp;will help it&nbsp;to&nbsp;bind with other proteins and improve your overall health.</strong> So&nbsp;the best way out of&nbsp;aging is&nbsp;to&nbsp;take supplements. <a href=#>According to&nbsp;research</a>, taking hydrolyzed collagen can slow down aging by&nbsp;27%, improve bone health, boost muscle mass, prevent bone loss and osteoporosis, and relieve joint pain.</p><p><h2>8. Whiten your teeth using fruit.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/792/69f/9ac95b546184ac3a2cf1807ae6.jpg><p>The best thing anyone can wear is&nbsp;a&nbsp;bright smile, but what about those times when you don’t feel confident showing your teeth because they seem a&nbsp;little bit yellow? Well, don’t worry because you can change all that depending on&nbsp;your diet. Fruits and vegetables that are rich in&nbsp;anti-oxidants can <a href=#>work wonders</a> when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;removing yellow stains from your teeth.</p><ul><li><strong>Strawberries </strong>can help whiten your teeth and remove both coffee and wine stains.</li><li><strong>Apples</strong> act as&nbsp;natural stain removers because they help produce more saliva in&nbsp;your mouth and serve as&nbsp;a&nbsp;“self-cleaning” agent.</li><li><strong>Oranges</strong> or&nbsp;any kind of&nbsp;tart fruit help to&nbsp;neutralize the acidity of&nbsp;your mouth that causes tooth decay.</li></ul><p><h2>9. Drink more coffee for a&nbsp;healthy gallbladder.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e8d/48d/25987455009a771aa7cb99b422.jpg><p>Even though coffee might be&nbsp;associated with an&nbsp;unhealthy diet, coffee in&nbsp;its purest form is&nbsp;actually good for you. Think about&nbsp;it: it’s bean juice made out of&nbsp;hot water and has a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;health benefits that we’ve covered before in&nbsp;<a href=#>other articles</a>. <strong>One of&nbsp;coffee’s most important benefits is&nbsp;that it&nbsp;promotes a&nbsp;healthy gallbladder.</strong></p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=#>research</a>, coffee activates contractions in&nbsp;the gallbladder which is&nbsp;believed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;the caffeine in&nbsp;it. In&nbsp;addition, research has revealed that <strong>increased gallbladder contractions resulting from coffee can prevent minor crystals in&nbsp;the gallbladder from becoming large gallbladder stones</strong>. So, you’d better get yourself a&nbsp;cup of&nbsp;hot coffee for a&nbsp;healthy gallbladder and next time someone tells you that you’re addicted, show them this article!</p><p>Which of&nbsp;these healthy life hacks would you like to&nbsp;try?
