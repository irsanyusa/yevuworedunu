The 24-year-old graced the <a href=#>America’s Got Talent</a> Stage on season 16 with her top notch quick change act and left us all in awe.</strong></p><p>But how much do we really know about this mysterious magician? Here, you will learn 10 facts you didn’t know about <a href=#>Heidi Klum’s</a> Golden Buzzer, Lea Kyle. Discover her talents outside of magic, her love life, and even a secret way you, the fans, can get in on her act.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><br><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-she-makes-all-her-own-outfits>1. She Makes All Her Own Outfits</h2><p>Before Lea took on her career in magic, she was actually a beautician.&nbsp;She put her sewing skills to use and combined her passion for fashion with her Golden Buzzer worthy talent.&nbsp;Through her Haute Couture fashion training, she is able to design and create all of her outfits for the quick change act.&nbsp;Considering how intricate her act is, you can definitely tell that she puts a lot of time into each design.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-her-current-boyfriend-performed-on-agt-as-well>2. Her Current Boyfriend Performed on AGT as Well</h2><p id=h-kyle-was-introduced-to-the-world-of-magic-when-she-met-her-boyfriend-florian-sainvet-7-years-ago-he-was-actually-a-contestant-on-america-s-got-talent-as-well-and-competed-on-season-15-before-being-eliminated-in-the-judge-cuts-one-day-he-asked-lea-to-perform-a-magic-set-with-him-on-stage-and-despite-being-shy-she-agreed>Lea was introduced to the world of magic when she met her boyfriend Florian Sainvet seven years ago.&nbsp;He was actually a contestant on America’s Got talent&nbsp;as well, and competed on season 15 before being eliminated in the Judge Cuts.&nbsp;One day, he asked Lea to perform a magic set with him on stage, and despite being shy, she agreed.&nbsp;After discovering the thrill of being in front of an audience, she wanted to continue, and she’s been on the road to success ever since.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B45RT6aIDzi/</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-lea-first-debuted-on-france-s-got-talent>3. Lea First Debuted on ‘France’s Got Talent’</h2><p>Season 16 of AGT is not the first time Lea has stepped foot on a talent show stage. The quick change queen traveled from her hometown of Bordeaux, France in order to showcase her talents. In her audition, you can see many of the signature tricks that won over Klum On AGT.&nbsp;</p><p>Truthfully, since appearing on the show in France, I believe her skills have only gotten better. From there, it soon became time to take her act to America for the very first time.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-lea-competed-as-a-horseback-rider>4. Lea Competed As a Horseback Rider</h2><p>A fact that I’m sure would surprise you, is that she is also a former horseback rider. She competed in horseback competitions for 10 years. She has said herself that&nbsp;horseback riding has given her a taste for competition, passion and self-improvement.&nbsp;It is very interesting to observe how her past experiences have led up to her career in magic.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-quick-change-is-not-the-only-kind-of-magic-she-performs>5. Quick Change is Not The Only Kind of Magic She Performs</h2><p>Before discovering her talent in the quick change genre, Lea dipped her toes in all kinds of magic.&nbsp;On Penn and Teller, she said at first she tried sleight of hand, but it wasn’t for her. Leave the sleight of hand to <a href=#>Shin Lim</a>. She went on to find the magic of quick change and I don’t think anyone in the game is doing it better than Lea.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-she-made-her-american-television-debut-on-penn-and-teller-s-fool-us>6. She Made Her American Television Debut on Penn and Teller’s Fool Us</h2><p>On this show, world renowned magicians Penn and Teller watch a variety of magic tricks in order to see if they can figure out the secrets behind the act.&nbsp;In 2020, Lea&nbsp;participated in the series filmed in Las Vegas.&nbsp;Amazingly, her quick change performance managed to stump two of the biggest magicians in the game, winning her the show’s “FU” (Fooled Us) trophy.&nbsp;On her episode, Lea pulled out all her signature tricks and beyond.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-she-has-won-many-awards>7. She Has Won Many Awards</h2><p>Lea has established herself as a professional in the world of magic before ever stepping foot on a talent show stage. In 2018, she won her first magic contest during the Villebarou International Festival.&nbsp;It was from that day that she was able to make a living from her passion and she became a professional magician.</p><p>In 2019, she was selected to participate in the French Magic Championships&nbsp;and won first prize in general magic and the title of French Champion that year.&nbsp;Most recently, in October 2020, Lea received what’s known as the&nbsp;“Mandrake d’or” a high distinction in the world of magic.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-8-her-agt-performance-made-her-a-viral-sensation>8. Her AGT Performance Made Her a Viral Sensation</h2><p>By now, it shouldn’t be too much of a surprise that Lea’s AGT audition made her a viral sensation.&nbsp;Her Golden Buzzer worthy performance has over 11 million views on YouTube today and was welcomed with an abundance of positive comments.&nbsp;She now has a dedicated fan base here in America and over 41,000 followers on Instagram. Lea frequently posts clips of her performances on that platform to give all her fans their daily dose of magic.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/ddlImQbD-sI</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-9-lea-kyle-can-perform-a-tailor-made-act-for-you>9.

In this unique act especially made for you, she can also showcase appearances of your products while creating costumes in your image. Fans can contact Lea directly though her <a href=# class=broken_link>official website.</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-10-the-magician-showcased-her-act-in-an-actual-clothing-store>10. The Magician Showcased Her Act in an Actual Clothing Store</h2><p>While back in her hometown of Bordeaux, Lea was able to model all of the clothes for the Camaieu boutique’s Winter collection. Within seconds, she tried on every article of clothing without ever stepping foot in a dressing room. Taking her skills from the stage to the store shows just how talented this quick change artist truly is.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CIqxHLgI0do/</p></figure><p>Lea also has a cat named Kiara, she also loves to play The Sims, and she is a vegetarian.
