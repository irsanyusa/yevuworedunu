He made his acting debut opposite David Hasselhoff in the Hawaii extension of the hugely popular series "Baywatch." Momoa played Jason Ioane from 1999 to 2001. He then made a name for himself by embracing genre television, first by playing the series regular role of Ronon Dex on four seasons of the Syfy series "Stargate Atlantis" (2005–2009) and then by playing Khal Drogo in the first two seasons of the HBO series Game of Thrones (2011–2012). It was his role as Khal Drogo that gained Momoa international recognition as an actor. Momoa's other stepping into television lead roles with "Frontier" (2016-2018), the Canadian historical drama where he played fur trapper Declan Harp for three seasons, and "See" (2019-2022), Apple TV+'s big-budget post-apocalyptic drama about a distant future where humanity has lost the ability to see. The show ran for three seasons and 24 episodes. As a film star, Momoa has played Duncan Idaho in Denis Villeneuve's "Dune" (2021) adaptation. He joined the "Fast and Furious" franchise in 2023 as the villainous Dante in "Fast X." His biggest film role to date is Aquaman in Warner Bros,' DC Universe. He was introduced as the superhero in Zack Snyder's "Justice League" (2017) before headlining his own "Aquaman" movie in 2018. The latter title proved to be a box office hit with over $1 billion in worldwide grosses. A sequel, "Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom," and a cameo appearance in "The Flash" continued Momoa's run as Aquaman on the big screen.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV%2BpfKut0qilZqWforyiew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
