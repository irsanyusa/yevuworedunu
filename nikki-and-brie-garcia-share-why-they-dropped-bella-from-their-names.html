The sisters were formerly known as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Bella Twins</a> during their time in the WWE, but they announced this week that they’re going back to their birth names.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nikki-and-brie-garcia-talk-about-changing-their-names>Nikki and Brie Garcia Talk About Changing Their Names</h2><p>At the same time they announced their new names, the sisters also announced that their podcast had been rebranded from The Bellas Podcast to The Nikki & Brie Show. During <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wednesday’s episode</a>, the sisters explained that as they’re approaching 40 and have become mothers and entrepreneurs, they knew it was time for a change.</p><p>“When our contract came up with WWE, mutually we all knew we just needed to head into this new chapter,” Nikki explained. “And we are so grateful for the past 17 years. I have learned so much in and out of that ring. I have traveled all over the world. I have an incredible fandom from over 146 countries.”</p><p>Nikki went on to say that it’s “a part of relationships” that sometimes you decide to “go separate ways.” She emphasized that it “doesn’t mean it’s forever.” Brie chimed in to say that it also “doesn’t mean it’s bad.” She called the decision “something beautiful” that was “years coming.”</p><p>Fans will also be happy to know that Nikki will be returning to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barmageddon for Season 2</a>. She noted that she wasn’t part of the recent renewal announcement due to the upcoming name change, but she’ll be going by Nikki Garcia on the show.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NIKKI AND BRIE DROP ‘BELLA’ FROM THEIR NAMES, WILL NOW GO BY GARCIA</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-aren-t-the-twins-going-by-their-married-names>Why Aren’t the Twins Going by Their Married Names?</h2><p>Some fans might be wondering why the twins chose to go back to their maiden names instead of their married names — Chigvintsev and Danielson. The sisters also explained this decision during Wednesday’s podcast.</p><p>Nikki explained that “everything legal” like their driver’s licenses will have their husbands’ last names. However, she also pointed out that her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">husband Artem Chigvintsev’s name</a> is “a real tough one.”</p><p>“Our dad right now is doing backflips,” Nikki continued. “He’s super excited, he’s super happy. Why not go back to our roots? We love our Mexican culture. And let’s go back to Garcia, how everyone knew us.”</p><p>During the podcast, the sisters also announced that they’ll be doing a live show in San Francisco at Cobb’s Comedy Club on April 19.
