Back then, Barker said he sold 300 trees in a month. In recent years, he said he has sold 1,000 to 1,200 in a two- to three-day period.</p><p class=mb-s>This year, when he opens on Nov. 27, he isn’t taking any risks when it comes to social distancing.&nbsp;</p><p class=mb-s>“We knew we couldn’t do the same thing we always have,” he said. “Everyone wants to come and get the biggest and the best trees as soon as we open up, but we knew we had to spread people out this year.”</p><p class=mb-s>Barker’s farm is using a reservation system, and plenty of hand sanitizer, this year, and saw 700 people sign up in the first week of November alone.</p><p class=mb-s>Big-box retailers are also expecting that shoppers will be interested in real Christmas trees this year. Lowe’s Cos., for instance, is offering delivery of fresh, local Christmas trees for those who want real trees but don’t feel comfortable venturing out to cut down their own.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX5i1s7XSraSaq12pv6axjKucmqRdlr%2B1tcWimqKZnGK9s7HFnqmeppOa</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
