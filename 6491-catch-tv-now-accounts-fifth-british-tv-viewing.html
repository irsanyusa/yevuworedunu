Parents of under-16s, who were questioned as part of the survey, estimate their kids watch on average seven hours of catch-up per week.</p><p>The research also indicated that even for the over 55s catch-up still makes up 14% of their viewing time.</p><p>Alongside these figures, the study identified a host of key changes and trends in the habits of telly addicts when it comes to the different technologies available to them.</p><p>While three quarters (77%) of those questioned still use their main TV the most, the average home now has four different devices (including their main TV) on which they can watch TV, which is just over double the number they had five years ago. However, this rises to an average of six devices for the 18-24 year olds questioned.</p><p>The online study of more than 2000 people, carried out by YouGov for on demand TV service YouView, also found that while the average home records around 10 programmes in a typical week, they delete four of those on average without watching them - with entertainment the mostly likely (36%) to be binned followed by films (32%) and documentaries (32%).</p><p><b>Steve Conway, Head of Marketing, YouView</b> said, “Television is a huge part of British life but we know the way people view it is changing beyond all recognition. What is becoming important to TV fans is being able to watch what they want, whenever they want it and this research supports that.</p><p>“Among 18-24 year olds, 37% said the ability to watch on demand TV was very important compared to a quarter nationally and as a nation we are craving more and more time with our favourite programmes, on our own terms.</p><p>“YouView seamlessly integrates live and on demand TV on your television and the results of this survey are interesting as it shows a quarter questioned are now watching more TV than five years ago and more than three quarters watch television content on their TV.”</p><p>The online research also found that across the country, alongside their TV, 57% of those questioned said they use their computer to watch television content, 14% do so through a games console like the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 and 25% access TV on a tablet with iPad and iPad mini the favourite at 19% vs. 6% for Android models.</p><p>Spending on subscription TV services has also increased by around 40% in five years with the average household monthly payment now £29.89. Nearly a quarter (23%) spend more than £50 per month. TV-related downloads also account for £1.56 per month from iTunes or the Google Play Store, with men spending £2.03 versus £1.13 for women.</p><p>For more information visit: <a href=#>www.youview.com</a></p><p><a href=#>See the full results</a></p><p><b>For further information and images please contact:</b></p><p>Victoria Fairclough <a href=#>victoria.fairclough@youview.com</a> 0203 5444119</p><p><b>Notes to Editors</b></p><p>The survey was carried out online by YouGov in May 2013 and questioned over 2000 adults aged 18 years old from across the UK, forming a nationally representative sample.
