According to <a href=# id=898c71c9-7017-358e-a55f-1b420b5be4d7>NPR</a> , initially, mid-February was when the Roman fertility festival of Lupercalia was held, where men sacrificed a goat and a dog and reportedly whipped women with the hides of the dead animals in the hopes of increasing the women's fertility.</p><p>According to <a href=# id=b0662265-ab02-3737-a42c-237d37409ccc>Britannica though</a> , Valentine's Day may have gotten its name from the execution of a priest named Valentine by Roman Emperor Claudius II on February 14 during the third century.</p><p>According to other accounts, however, the holiday is named after <a href=# id=54dcb242-ac71-30a8-aecd-c0004ef92505>St. Valentine of Terni</a> , a bishop, that was martyred in 269 C.E. for marrying Christian couples.</p><p>The day became established as a holiday by Pope Gelasius I at the end of the fifth century but formal valentines didn't <a href=# id=77eb5805-d0ce-34e1-af57-a505c1b00f9a>appear until the 1500s</a> .</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-30>Valentines Day encourages comparison, which isnt good for anyone</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-773dccd5-1482-4265-b6cc-69144e525f35 data-caption="anxiety sad phone texting"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/KK1ktktTURBXy9hNTIzNzNlOS0zMGFiLTQyNTUtODUwMC0xMTZkN2FhZDFjZmEucG5nkZUCzQMWzQJRwsM></span><p>As pictures of happy couples flood your social media page on Valentine's Day, it can be easy to question your own relationship. You might start to wonder how your relationship compares to these seemingly picture-perfect ones. This mentality, however, can be both destructive and misleading.</p><p><a href=# id=58d748de-bf48-37e2-af64-aeae3a5d9d54>Marie Hartwell-Walker, Ed.D.</a> confronted this issue for <a href=# id=174281d9-70b4-3ee6-aead-08d2be005e13>PsychCentral</a> , writing, "It's ridiculous to compare yourself with what you only think is going on." According to Hartwell-Walker, because you can never really know what's going on in someone else's relationship, it's all too easy to idealize what you see on social media and end up feeling down about your own relationship.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-34>Though Valentines Day is all about love, it actually leaves people out</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-e96b146f-91f7-430c-a514-1a450cb652c3 data-caption=couple><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/6c9ktktTURBXy8xZjcwNDhhMS05MWFiLTRjNDctYTFlZi1jOTQ5YTc3NjQ1NjYucG5nkZUCzQMWzQJRwsM></span><p>Even though the day is supposedly all about love, it's really just about romantic relationships, which leaves out single people and there are a lot of single people.</p><p>According to <a href=# id=735bad8d-7e63-360e-a0a7-c4926dca6a1b>CNN</a> , 47.3% of the population in the US in 2016 who were 18 or older were single (divorced, widowed, separated, or never married), or around 115.78 million people.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-38>Its actually a very wasteful holiday</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-9ed9f89e-2a9a-4141-8a0f-a92f2adc7585 data-caption="flowers bouquet"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/FITktktTURBXy8wMGJkMGY3YS1hNWIzLTQ3N2EtYmJjNS1lMjc5M2JkNDUzOTAucG5nkZUCzQMWzQJRwsM></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Further, the industry behind the more modest gift of flowers has negative environmental implications, according to the <a href=# id=a5e30572-5069-3029-ac35-85abd885e679>World Resources Institute</a> .</p><p>Because there isn't much regulation surrounding the cut-flower industry, agrochemicals that negatively affect air, soil, and water are used extensively and <a href=# id=c3495e32-c68e-3972-a34f-66f3e24252a2>pesticides are used more frequently</a> for these flowers than for foods.</p><p>Plus, think of all the cards and candy in plastic packaging that are purchased around Valentine's Day that eventually just end up in the trash.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7y6Kdnqukrrmme5dmqZ6Zo6S7tHnWobBmrpGhsq%2FAyKecrGWUlsZutdJmq6GdXay8s7%2FTaGtqa2Fovbs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
