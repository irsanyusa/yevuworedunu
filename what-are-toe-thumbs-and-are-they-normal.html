 Basically, toe thumbs occur when the last bone on the thumb-or the distal phalanx-is congenitally shortened, says Badia."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

According to&nbsp;&nbsp;published in the&nbsp;Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases, the prevalence ranges anywhere from 0.41 percent to 4 percent, with a particularly higher occurrence of toe thumbs reported amongst Israeli Arabs and in the Japanese population.</p><p>And if you have 'em, then it's typically an all-in-the-family situation: Badia says toe thumbs are commonly inherited independently of other hereditary traits, and are “associated with the HOXD13 gene, which is thought to be critical in digit development.”</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-8>So...is it bad to have toe thumbs?</h3></p><p>Nope. There are no functional consequences that come with toe thumbs other than the fact that certain hobbies or professions-say, a pianist-might require or prefer a longer thumb “for obvious reasons,” Badia says.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“There really is no specific management or treatment for this condition,” he adds. “And any attempts at cosmetic lengthening of the distal phalanx [thumb] can lead to further damage or deformity to the nail matrix which is responsible for nailplate growth and appearance,”</p><p>So yeah, it sounds like if you've got toe thumbs like Megan Fox, you're kinda stuck with them. Honestly, there are worse problems to have though, amirite?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZMSwucSnqmaglZa5tbSOsJ%2BarF2Wv6Z506icZqyYqrqjv4yapZ1lkaeybsDHnrBmpp%2BnuqK4jqeabqmWooI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
