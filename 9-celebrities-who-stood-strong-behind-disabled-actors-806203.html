This is&nbsp;how these celebrities stood behind some of&nbsp;the disabled actors in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> and won hearts.</p><p><h2>1. Angelina Jolie found a&nbsp;way for deaf actors to&nbsp;receive cues.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5d3/668/7beb1f58a6b6d286787bbeff6d.jpg><p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>latest</a> movie, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Eternals</i></a>, was especially cool because, for the first time, it&nbsp;featured a&nbsp;superhero with a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>disability</a>. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Lauren Ridloff</a> played Eternal Makkari and is&nbsp;a&nbsp;deaf actor in&nbsp;real life.</p><p>One unique challenge she faced was how to&nbsp;get the cue to&nbsp;start shooting when she wasn’t looking at&nbsp;the other actors. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Angelina Jolie</a>, who plays Thena in&nbsp;the movie, came to&nbsp;her rescue.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Said</a> Ridloff: “In&nbsp;some scenes, I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;face a&nbsp;wall. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;deaf person, how do&nbsp;you cue&nbsp;me? At&nbsp;one point, I&nbsp;was sharing my&nbsp;frustration with Angie&nbsp;— <a href=# title="Angelina Jolie" data-link=tag>Angelina Jolie</a>&nbsp;— at&nbsp;a&nbsp;holiday party after a&nbsp;day of&nbsp;shooting. And she immediately made a&nbsp;suggestion, ’Why don’t we&nbsp;<strong>use a&nbsp;laser pen that special effects can easily erase</strong>?’ It&nbsp;was an ‘Aha, wow’ moment. Whenever I’m looking at&nbsp;a&nbsp;wall, the interpreters would use a&nbsp;laser pen to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;circle on&nbsp;the wall&nbsp;— ‘rolling, rolling, rolling’ — and once it&nbsp;went away, that meant, ‘Action!’”</p><p><h2>2. Marlee Matlin threatened to&nbsp;quit if&nbsp;non-disabled actors played a&nbsp;deaf role.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/969/501/0bbad05629ab3a17049b211f97.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Marlee Matlin</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;deaf actor who has been seen in&nbsp;many roles in&nbsp;TV series like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Law &&nbsp;Order: SVU</i></a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>CSI</i></a><i> </i>before finally landing a&nbsp;part in&nbsp;an&nbsp;award-winning movie, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>CODA</i></a>. <i>CODA</i> stands for children of&nbsp;deaf adults, and Matlin plays a&nbsp;deaf mother of&nbsp;a&nbsp;hearing child in&nbsp;the Sundance-award-winning movie.</p><p>While she loved the script, she almost walked out on&nbsp;the project when learned that the producers were planning on&nbsp;hiring non-disabled actors to&nbsp;play deaf actors. Her tactics worked and they hired more deaf actors to&nbsp;fill the roles of&nbsp;the deaf characters.</p><p>Matlin <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “So&nbsp;you <strong>see what happens when you make noise? You make great things happen</strong>. It&nbsp;won 4&nbsp;awards at&nbsp;Sundance; the recognition has never been afforded like before. And it&nbsp;got an&nbsp;overwhelming response.”</p><p><h2>3. Adam Sandler made sure Maysoon Zayid could access her trailer herself.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/225/ddf/0c3e4552d78d43aaac2e51d8e5.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Maysoon Zayid</a> is&nbsp;an&nbsp;American actress and comedian who was born with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cerebral palsy</a>. However, she does not let that define her, as&nbsp;she played Zahra Amir on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>General Hospital</i></a>, where the character is&nbsp;not written as&nbsp;disabled. As&nbsp;Zayid says, “She is&nbsp;disabled because&nbsp;I, the actress who plays her, am.”</p><p>She also remembers how <a href=# title="Adam Sandler" data-link=tag>Adam Sandler</a> and the production team of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>You Don’t Mess With the Zohan</i></a> went out of&nbsp;their way to&nbsp;make the set disability-inclusive. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Said</a> Zayid: “<strong>They added a&nbsp;ramp on&nbsp;my&nbsp;trailer and gave me&nbsp;a&nbsp;dresser to&nbsp;help with costume changes</strong>. A&nbsp;[man] named Darryl drove me&nbsp;to&nbsp;and from the set in&nbsp;a&nbsp;silver Mercedes golf cart. It&nbsp;was heaven...”</p><p><h2>4. Hailee Steinfeld introduced herself to&nbsp;her deaf co-star in&nbsp;sign language.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/24e/53d/e44f06585ab0a46a5e0a301e39.jpg><p>The second deaf superhero in&nbsp;the Marvel Cinematic Universe is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Echo</a>, as&nbsp;in&nbsp;Maya Lopez, played by&nbsp;newbie actor, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Alyqua Cox</a>. Cox is&nbsp;deaf in&nbsp;real life and was a&nbsp;bit nervous about being on&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Hawkeye</i></a> series set for the first time.</p><p>But Cox claims both her co-stars, Jeremy Renner and Hailee Steinfeld, went out of&nbsp;their way to&nbsp;make her feel comfortable. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Said</a> the deaf actor: “I&nbsp;remember meeting Jeremy on&nbsp;my&nbsp;first day of&nbsp;work on-set; I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;nervous wreck, as&nbsp;this was my&nbsp;very first acting job. <strong>He&nbsp;then complimented me&nbsp;in&nbsp;American Sign Language</strong> (ASL), which comforted&nbsp;me. Hailee also spelled out her name to&nbsp;me&nbsp;in&nbsp;ASL at&nbsp;the studio where we&nbsp;were doing our stunt training sessions. I&nbsp;thought <strong>it&nbsp;was sweet of&nbsp;them to&nbsp;put in&nbsp;efforts to&nbsp;learn basic ASL to&nbsp;communicate with&nbsp;me</strong>. It&nbsp;means a&nbsp;lot to&nbsp;me&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;deaf person.”</p><p><h2>5. Jameela Jamil turned down a&nbsp;disabled role so&nbsp;that an&nbsp;actor with a&nbsp;disability could take&nbsp;it.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8a9/8a6/aeeb335156990a999ac79a98c0.jpg><p>British actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Jameela Jamil</a> was born partially deaf but can now hear. So&nbsp;when she was offered the role of&nbsp;a&nbsp;deaf woman, she turned it&nbsp;down.</p><p>Jamil <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>, “I&nbsp;said it&nbsp;wouldn’t be&nbsp;appropriate for me&nbsp;to&nbsp;take that role and they should find a&nbsp;brilliant deaf woman to&nbsp;play that role. <strong>I&nbsp;think you have to&nbsp;make those choices and not be&nbsp;too greedy and make space rather than take space.</strong>”</p><p><h2>6. John Krasinski pushed to&nbsp;cast deaf actor Millicent Simmonds in&nbsp;the role of&nbsp;a&nbsp;deaf person.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/99c/fd0/4ffb3650b1882dcb359d676c46.jpg><p>When <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>John Krasinski</a> was making <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>A&nbsp;Quiet Place</i></a>, the decision to&nbsp;cast a&nbsp;non-hearing actor to&nbsp;play the deaf daughter was a&nbsp;non-negotiable choice. Enter <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Millicent Simmonds</a>, a&nbsp;deaf actor known for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Wonderstruck</i></a>.</p><p>Krasinski spoke to&nbsp;Simmonds’ family to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;better perspective as&nbsp;to&nbsp;how hearing parents managed with a&nbsp;deaf child and vice versa. In&nbsp;the movie, when the focus shifts to&nbsp;Millicent’s character, Regan, the sound is&nbsp;off, giving the world a&nbsp;little perspective into what it&nbsp;feels like to&nbsp;be&nbsp;deaf. Krasinski recalls that when he&nbsp;revealed this production method to&nbsp;Simmonds’ mother, she broke down.</p><p>Krasinski <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “To&nbsp;see her mom come up&nbsp;to&nbsp;me&nbsp;crying as&nbsp;hard as&nbsp;she was, was the most moving experience. She said, ‘I’ve always wanted to&nbsp;know what the experience was with my&nbsp;daughter and&nbsp;I finally have it.’”</p><p><h2>7. Octavia Spencer believes every disabled actor should be&nbsp;represented authentically.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/563/8f6/aa540b541d940674a500aa6d27.jpg><p>Actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Octavia Spencer</a>, known for movies like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Hidden Figures</i></a>, has struggled with dyslexia in&nbsp;her early years. Recently, she joined the Ruderman Family Foundation and has urged Hollywood, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;whole, to&nbsp;focus more on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>inclusivity</a>. The idea is&nbsp;to&nbsp;hire people with disabilities to&nbsp;portray similar challenges on&nbsp;the screen.</p><p>In&nbsp;the 3-minute clip, Spencer said, “Casting [non-disabled] actors in&nbsp;roles for characters with disabilities is&nbsp;offensive, unjust, and deprives an&nbsp;entire community of&nbsp;people from opportunities.”</p><p><h2>8. Jeremy Renner was happy to&nbsp;weave in&nbsp;hearing aids for his Hawk-Eye character, Clint Barton.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/24c/d41/60c70f5314bd797240b3226ede.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Jeremy Renner</a>, who plays Clint Barton, as&nbsp;in&nbsp;Hawkeye in&nbsp;the MCU movies and series, is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hard of&nbsp;hearing</a> in&nbsp;real life. His comic book avatar is&nbsp;also shown to&nbsp;develop hearing loss over the years in&nbsp;the Disney+ series, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Hawkeye</i></a>, and it’s something Renner has welcomed with open arms.</p><p>Renner <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “I’m only hard of&nbsp;hearing, so&nbsp;I’m not deaf. I&nbsp;thought it&nbsp;was just a&nbsp;really wonderful thing, cause it&nbsp;is, it’s always been a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;Clint’s character in&nbsp;the comics, and we&nbsp;found a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;a&nbsp;truthful entry point for his life and how it&nbsp;affects [his] life. And now, there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;wonderful vulnerability that comes&nbsp;in.”</p><p><h2>9. Harry Styles helped deaf co-star Lauren Ridloff know when the cameras stopped rolling.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/370/cbd/3966ec5faaad02e15ccb3fcfa2.jpg><p>The MCU movie, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Eternals</i></a>,<i> </i>brought in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Harry Styles</a> as&nbsp;Thanos’ brother, Eros. Styles immediately bonded with the cast, especially deaf actor Lauren Ridloff, who plays Eternal Makkari. Ridloff shared a&nbsp;little story about a&nbsp;deleted scene where the Eternals and Eros are sitting aboard the starship Domo, communicating with the Celestial Arishem with their eyes closed.</p><p>Ridloff <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “Chloe [Zhao, the director] would say, ’Cut,’ and every time she yelled, ’Cut,’ the interpreter would have to&nbsp;run around and tap me&nbsp;on&nbsp;the shoulder. So&nbsp;after a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;times, Harry was just like, ’Is it&nbsp;okay if&nbsp;I just tap you and cue you when we&nbsp;stop shooting? I&nbsp;was like, ’Yeah, thank you!’ That’s just who Harry is: He&nbsp;just watches out, and he&nbsp;thinks: ’What can&nbsp;I do?’”</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think about these celebrities lending a&nbsp;helping hand? Which disabled actor do&nbsp;you remember the most in&nbsp;a&nbsp;role?</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;revealing article, Angelina Jolie discusses her <a href=#>unique relationships</a> with her adoptive and biological daughters.
