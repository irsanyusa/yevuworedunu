Apparently, her labor turned out to be a stressful one unlike any other normal baby delivery.</p><p>According to the dancer, she had a scheduled C-section two days later than the day she felt contractions. Her doctors nonetheless disregarded the original plan and pushed through with labor. Arnold then stated that the process was initially calm but eventually became complicated when the doctors realized that June’s umbilical cord was wrapped around her neck “six times.”</p><p>“I could tell that [Sam Cusick] was very stressed and I could sense that the energy in the room started changing a little bit,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p><p>The dancer went on and stated that the doctors had a hard time pulling her baby out because as they try to get her head out, the cord compressed. Despite the unusual situation, Arnold praised how incredible the doctors were during the time.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Arnold</a>, her husband Sam Cusick has taped the entire stressful yet successful delivery. She, however, has decided not to show the tense situation in the delivery room, describing it as a “gruesome” and “scary” watch. &nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-feels-blessed-on-mother-s-day>She Feels “Blessed” on Mother’s Day</h2><p>In celebration of Mother’s Day, Arnold posted adorable snaps of her with Sage and June, all of them wearing matchy dainty dresses. Along with the photos, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> pro penned a sweet caption.</p><p>“Feeling so blessed this Mother’s Day with my two girls,” she wrote. “Beyond grateful that god chose me to be their mom I will never take it for granted. Sending love to all today.”</p><p>Evidently, Arnold has been seizing her wholesome and happy memories as a mother. Last May 9, the professional dancer shared a video of Sage meeting June for the first time. According to Arnold, she’s never felt more love after seeing her daughter’s first ever interaction.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Original_KatyPerry_Incredibles_ABC_Eric-McCandless-220x147.jpg alt="Katy Perry Adds Elastigirl to Her List of Iconic Disney Costumes on ‘American Idol’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Lindsay Arnold</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57y6KlnauRrnqivs2oo51llJrBorXLrGSbmZKueqvBzZ6qZpqZp8GpedKtpquxXZ67brrEsJysrF2rubCzjJ6noqufmbJw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
