She has an interesting tone and rasp, making her someone who could make it far. Plus, everyone loves the younger singers on The Voice! She checks all the boxes.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bra7a0IhH_l/</p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Cecily Hennigan</h4><p>Cecily went viral when she <a href=#>sang her order</a> at the McDonald’s drive-thru. Now, she’ll be appearing on The Voice to show off what she can do. And from what we’ve seen so far, she has a lot to offer!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BfL6OwEgoeH/</p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>The Bundys</h4><p>The Bundys are the first trio in The Voice history! They are siblings from Cincinnati, now living in Nashville. And their harmonies are on point! But a non-solo artist hasn’t made it far on the show in many years. So could they be the first in a long time? It’s definitely possible!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Dexter Roberts</h4><p>You may remember Dexter from Season 13 of American Idol! He made it to the Top 7 then. But he will be back on the small screen to try to take home the win this time around. And he’s perfect for Team Blake.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BruVY5wBync/</p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Lisa Ramey</h4><p>Lisa is a recording artist from New York. She will for sure be memorable, for her smooth vocals and self-proclaimed “Rayhawk.” Her high notes are insane too!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bp-NiaYHDym/</p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Rebecca Howell</h4><p>Rebecca is an 18 year old singer from Georgia. She tackles some pretty big songs, by artists like Carrie Underwood and Etta James, and manages to do pretty well with them. That’s a great sign going into the next season of The Voice! We could see her do big things.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BnXRxcOA0Uq/</p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Jej Millanes</h4><p>Jej is one of my personal favorites from the batch! He has a background in acapella, singing as part of USC’s <a href=#>SoCal Vocals</a>. He even helped lead the group to an ICCA win in 2018! Jej is a contender for the Season 16 title in my opinion.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BhpMavbAmMC/</p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Alena D’Amico</h4><p>Alena is a singer-songwriter who owns a bridal makeup/hair company. Her brother was on Married at First Sight and just had a baby with his wife from the show. Wild, and I’m sure that will be part of her backstory. But she has a crazy good voice too!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BqVSxKyhMfY/</p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Kendra Checketts</h4><p>Kendra is a 19 year old singer from the San Diego area. She definitely has some vocal prowess! And last season’s winner, Chevel Shepherd, has been commenting on her Instagram as well. So clearly we’re not the only ones taking notice!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BhSeCC8lHGC/</p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Andrew Jannakos</h4><p>This is just another straight up talented singer. Andrew has some RANGE! He is a musician from Atlanta, Georgia. Andrew seems to be primarily a country singer, but he dabbles in other music too. I think we could see him do some really cool things!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BrL-lPAHyK_/</p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Mari</h4><p>I might be partial because I’m on a H.E.R. kick right now but Mari killed this! And everything else on her social is fire too. Mari has an insane tone and she’s just so easy to listen to. I look forward to seeing her Blind Audition!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bgr0DOQBbqQ/</p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Patrick & Ruby McAloon</h4><p>Patrick McAloon and his daughter Ruby both auditioned for The Voice separately. Will they end up on the same team? Or opposing teams? Or will either of them turn chairs at all? Well that’s the fun of the show! We’ll find out in the next few weeks. But I have a feeling at least one of them will turn a chair.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Oliv Blu</h4><p>My fingers are crossed that Oliv joins Team John! She has a similar style to him and I could see her going far under his coaching. Oliv has a lot of soul!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BkWJDBvhz3O/</p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Talon Cardon</h4><p>Talon could very well be the young heartthrob of Season 16. His <a href=# class=broken_link>Instagram </a>reveals that he also auditioned for American Idol, but didn’t make it past the Denver rounds. Hopefully he’ll have better luck on The Voice, because he’s a talented singer!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bn4zkxcHzqV/</p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Abby Kasch</h4><p>Abby is a 20-year-old singer-songwriter who has opened for Scotty McCreery. She is originally from the Chicago area but now performs across the country and in some of Nashville’s top venues. She could be the country girl to watch this season, hoping to follow in Chevel’s footsteps!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bfzr9m8HWQ_/</p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Karly Moreno</h4><p>Karly is a 22-year-old singer-songwriter from Orange County. She has an indie sound and is currently working on her first E.P. But if her covers are any indication, it should be outstanding!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Br57mv9hBvf/</p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Rod Stokes</h4><p>Rod is a country singer from Tennessee who reminds me of Pryor Baird. He will definitely bring energy to the show! And from the looks of his social, being on The Voice could be his first big break. All his videos so far are from inside his house! Humble beginnings, I guess.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Kalvin Jarvis</h4><p>Kalvin is a singer from Tucson, Arizona. He won a competition put on by his <a href=#>local NBC station</a> to win an all-expense paid trip to a regional casting call! So he’s already won once, will he be able to do it on the actual show?</p><p>The Voice premieres on Monday, February 25th. We’ll see all these artists and plenty more audition then!</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Donnie-Wahlberg-Rabbit-Masked-Singer.jpg alt="Is Donnie Wahlberg the Rabbit on ‘The Masked Singer’?
