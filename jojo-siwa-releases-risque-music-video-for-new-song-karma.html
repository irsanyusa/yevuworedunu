Both the song and video go against the wholesome image Siwa has been known for in the past, as she enters a more grown-up era.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jojo-siwa-releases-music-video-for-song-karma>JoJo Siwa Releases Music Video for Song ‘Karma’</h2><p>Siwa has been doing the most to promote her new song “Karma,” as she’s been teasing the track on social media for weeks. In March, she even shared a warning that the “content is not made for children” and “may contain sexual themes, violence, strong language, traumatic scenarios, and flashing lights.”</p><p>The music video released on Friday isn’t quite as controversial as Siwa made it out to be, but fans of her former bubbly persona might find it to be a bit risqué. The clip features a few suggestive dance moves and revealing outfits, but that’s about it.</p><p>The plot of the video starts with Siwa on a boat, seeming caught between two women. After an intense dance routine, she ends up falling off the boat and washing up on an island. She shows off yet another dance routine, this time wearing a dark outfit and gothic makeup.</p><p>“Karma’s a b*tch,” Siwa sings on the track’s chorus, although she doesn’t go so far as to sing the F-word. Instead, she uses the phrase “effed around.” Still, parents of Siwa’s younger fans might not approve of this more mature persona the 20-year-old is cultivating.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">JOJO SIWA TEASES NEW PROJECT THAT IS ‘NOT MADE FOR CHILDREN’</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-do-fans-think-of-the-new-project>What Do Fans Think of the New Project?</h2><p>Unfortunately, the reaction to Siwa’s new song and music video hasn’t exactly been positive. Even fans on Siwa’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram account</a> have been poking fun at how much the star promoted the project, with one commenter joking that they “had no idea you were releasing a song.”</p><p>Another commenter described the music video as “like Lady Gaga for kids.” Someone else wrote that it was “just as disappointing as I thought.” And the comments on YouTube weren’t much better, with one person <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">writing</a>, “The target audience of this was missed… because there is no human being that would be the target audience for this.”</p><p>“Just because you’re famous, doesn’t mean you have to have a musical career,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> another commenter. People also weren’t a fan of the dance moves, with several commenters complaining about the “humping.”</p><p>What do you think about Siwa’s new song and video? Do you approve of this new style?
