The Original Trilogy
Star Wars is made up of three trilogies that were (illogically) made out of order. First came episodes IV, V and VI. That’s Star Wars: A New Hope in 1977, The Empire Strikes Back in 1980 and Return of the Jedi in 1983."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That’s <i>Star Wars: A New Hope</i> in 1977, <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> in 1980 and <i>Return of the Jedi</i> in 1983. In that trilogy the good guys (the Rebellion and the Jedi) fight the bad guys (the Empire ruled by the Sith). When people refer to the “original trilogy” they are referring to these movies. Most of this glossary will deal with these films since they are widely considered far superior to the prequels.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>The Prequels</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But just so you’re aware: The prequels were <i>Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace </i>(1999)<i>, Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones</i> (2002) and <i>Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith</i> (2005). This chronicles the story of how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader, the main bad guy in the earlier (but actually later) trilogy. Both the first and second trilogies were directed by George Lucas.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>The New Films</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The new movie, <i><a href=# rel=noopener>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</a></i> is the first installment in the new trilogy. It was directed by J.J. Abrams and includes the stars of the original cast, Harrison Ford (Han Solo), Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia) and Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker). It will be followed by two more <i>Star Wars </i>films, now being called just episodes VIII and IX.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And as if that weren’t enough, Disney and Lucasfilm are also planning a number of <i>Star Wars</i> spinoff films, one of which will be called <i>Rogue One</i> and another of which focuses on a younger version of Han Solo, the Harrison Ford character.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>The Force</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s how the movie explains it: “The Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It’s an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together.” Basically, certain people can use their mind to move objects, to control what people do and think, and more, all using microscopic organisms called midi-chlorians. Not everyone can use the Force, but those who can can use it for good or evil. The Jedi use the light side, the Sith the dark side.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Jedi</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Long ago, there used to be many Jedi Knights who kept the peace and fought the Sith. Eventually, however, the Sith took over and killed all but a few Jedi. In episodes IV, V and VI, the Jedi join forces with the Rebellion to defeat the Empire. Someone in training to become a Jedi, known as a Padawan or a Jedi apprentice, trains one-on-one with a Jedi Master.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Lightsaber</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A blade made of pure energy wielded by those who can use the force. Generally speaking, Sith use red blades.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Luke Skywalker</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Luke Skywalker learns the ways of the Force first from Obi-Wan Kenobi then from Yoda and becomes a Jedi Knight. Along the way, he develops a crush on a princess named Leia, but it turns out she’s his sister. He also loses his hand to Darth Vader, though ultimately he saves the galaxy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Darth Vader</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Darth Vader is the ultimate bad guy. As a child, he was Anakin Skywalker but when he went to the dark side (i.e. became a bad guy) he earned the title “Darth,” which basically just means dark lord. He also (spoiler alert) turns out to be Luke and Leia’s father. (In fact, the reason he went from being a Jedi in training to a Sith is because Chancellor Palpatine—who becomes the emperor—promised that he would be able to save the life of his wife, Padme, who was going to die. That didn’t pan out.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Princess Leia</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Leia begins the series being captured by Darth Vader. She’s rescued by Luke and Han, though she quickly makes it clear that she’s the one really in charge—not the boys.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Han Solo</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A reckless but charming smuggler and space cowboy, Han Solo and his sidekick Chewbacca help Luke and Leia save the galaxy. He and Leia also fall in love.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Death Star</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A space station that Darth Vader uses to blow up planet. The Rebellion destroys it at the beginning of Episode IV, but the empire builds another one for Episode VI (which the rebels also destroy).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>The Millennium Falcon</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Han Solo’s dirty but awesome ship.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Stormtrooper</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">These are soldiers in white body armor who work for the Empire.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Yoda</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The small, green, 900-year-old Jedi Master who trains Luke.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Droid</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A robot with artificial intelligence.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>C-3PO</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A tall, gold robot who is always worrying.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>R2-D2</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A cute white and blue robot who makes beeping noises and often accompanies Luke on his flights.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Clones</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Soldiers of the Republic, the governing body in episodes I, II and III.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtaWVlfXqEjqyrmqpdrK6zv4ytn55llqS%2FpLGMmq6ao5WjwG7AxKukrGWXqralsY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
