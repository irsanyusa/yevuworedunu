Here are some quick tips to help you on your quest for the perfect pair.</p><h3>Where will you wear your joggers?</h3><p>According to Retail and Shopping Expert Jeanel Alvarado of <a rel=nofollow href=#>RETAILBOSS</a> it’s important to consider the main use of the joggers, whether for athletic activities, lounging, or casual outings—or all of the above. “If you’re wearing the joggers inside, you may want to opt for joggers with a combination of fleece,” she suggests. And if they’re for the summer months, she advises sticking to cotton blends.</p><p>Athletes looking for a pair to hike or workout in will also want to invest in joggers in breathable materials with some stretch, as well as look for features like zipper pockets to keep their phone and keys from falling out.</p><h3>How do they fit?</h3><p>This is where reading reviews can come in handy. Joggers are generally slim fit, though some can be a little bit more relaxed in the legs. Reviews can help you determine whether to size up, size down, purchase your regular size or search for a completely different pair altogether. Look for features like drawstrings, which will allow you to adjust the waistband for a tighter or looser fit depending on the type of activity you’re doing.</p><h2 id=how-we-selected-the-best-joggers-for-women>How we selected the best joggers for women</h2><p>We spoke with a retail and shopping expert with more than 15 years of experience to discover exactly what to look for in the best joggers for women, from material and fit to practical style details. We also garnered valuable insight from her on the styles currently trending today.</p><p>Additionally, we used our own personal knowledge and experience with joggers from top fashion and athleisure brands, poured through plenty of customer reviews and asked real women to share their favorites and why they love them. We carefully considered bestsellers and only included joggers with an average rating of 4.5 or higher.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>How to style joggers for women?</h3><p>While it will depend on the type of joggers you’re wearing, in general, they’re super versatile and look great styled with a simple t-shirt tucked in the front or a cropped tee or tank if you’re rocking a high-waisted style, which are all the rage these days. “Styling joggers can be as simple or as elaborate as you want it to be by simply changing up the footwear,” notes Alvarado.</p><p>“A new trend is wearing mid-length boots with joggers tucked in, to give a throwback to the 90s vibe,” she says. “Platform boots can make the look more edgy with a combat style, or pointed high heels can give that JLo signature look.” For a more casual yet polished appearance, she recommends pairing your joggers with white sneakers.</p><h3>What is the best material for joggers?</h3><p>According to Alvarado, most jogger materials are a combination of cotton, fleece, and polyester, while some may also contain spandex or viscose for added stretch. “Most high-quality joggers are made of 100% cotton, as cotton is particularly favored due to its lightness and ability to absorb water, making it an excellent choice for all year round.”</p><h3>What top to wear with joggers?</h3><p>From cropped tanks and bodysuits to your fave blazer, there are so many chic tops you can rock with joggers. “You can style joggers with sweatshirts, tanks, bralettes, sweaters, long-sleeve tops, t-shirts, camisoles, and even button-down shirts,” says Alvarado. “The key is to choose a top that complements the style and fit of your joggers, whether you're going for a casual or more dressed-up look.” For a sporty, running-errands-all-day or just chilling kind of vibe, pair your joggers with a fitted tank top or a solid black bodysuit. For a dressy, casual-cool work look, throw on an oversized blazer or dress it down with a short jacket for an effortless look, suggests Alvarado.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lmqS0qLHRZp2oql2svK6xzWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
