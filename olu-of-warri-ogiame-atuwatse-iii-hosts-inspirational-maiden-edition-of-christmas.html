Dr <strong>Omatshole Kpiase</strong> gave a brief exposé into some unknown facts about His Majesty, Ogiame Atuwatse III the Olu of Warri, citing his love for Classical and Gospel Music; including how the King and His wife, Olori Atuwatse, have remained passionate about hosting Christian musical events from time to time in the Palace prior to his ascension to the throne.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-cb54b4b5-fc93-45b5-8b0e-d14dd321dd33 data-caption="Olu of Warri, Ogiame Atuwatse III hosts inspirational maiden edition of Christmas Carol Service in Warri"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/M24ktkpTURBXy82ZjVlMmNiMzMwZWYwZTQ1MDMyOTBiOGNlNzhlM2NkMC5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAm3Cww></span><p>According to him, this innate desire of the King led to the formation of the Iwere Choir, who are well-revered for their ecclesiastical performances of classical and gospel songs. He then ushered guests into the first rendition of the evening, Silent Night, led by the Iwere Choir. It was such a fine and melodious tune that raised guests' hearts to higher spirits, lifting moods and bringing smiles on faces.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-fd1a68ba-3c2f-4bbc-877a-ec1c74b24c5a data-caption="Olu of Warri, Ogiame Atuwatse III hosts inspirational maiden edition of Christmas Carol Service in Warri"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/sUMktkpTURBXy82NjA0NDhhM2RmM2ViMmZjOTNiMTgyYTM2ZDhmOTAyOC5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAg_Cww></span><p>The Iwere choir set the event's tone with an Orchestra performance that sparked electricity throughout the Palace atmosphere within and outside the church, spurring guests into a holiday mood. In a move that displayed the Olu of Warri as a King for his people and a man of his word, reinstating his commitment to instilling gender equality in his Kingdom, a young woman made the stage to introduce the immediate past governor of Delta State, Dr <strong>Emmanuel Uduaghan</strong>.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-ef05acdc-56ae-446f-aadd-a7257336f896 data-caption="Olu of Warri, Ogiame Atuwatse III hosts inspirational maiden edition of Christmas Carol Service in Warri"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/djUktkpTURBXy8zYjM1YWRhMjlkMWNiMTY5NzA1Y2RhOWNjYzI1NTZkZS5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAg_Cww></span><p>Following his scripture reading of the Bible from Luke 1:26-38, the former governor praised the Warri kingdom for her outstanding qualities, encouraging citizens to remain steadfast in their commitment to God. He ended his speech with the phrase, "Itsekiri! With God, nothing is impossible!"</p><p>Abuja-based vocalist, <strong>Chinonyerem Ndukwe</strong>, overwhelmed the congregation and invigorated the atmosphere with some soulful yet pulsating solo performances of some popular Christmas hymns that thrilled guests enough to sing along.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-0429a419-9960-404a-9db5-7dce0c6f5923 data-caption="Olu of Warri, Ogiame Atuwatse III hosts inspirational maiden edition of Christmas Carol Service in Warri"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/vvpktkpTURBXy9jZjFmOWIyNDY2OTlmYTcyNzAxMmJjZWVmM2I5MjI5NS5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAg_Cww></span><p>Other songs that debuted at the Carol night included The First Noel, Silent Night, Hallelujah Itse, God, Save The King, O come all ye faithful, Hark The Herald Angel Sing, and many other hymns, primarily sung in Itsekiri.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Apostle<strong> Tom Arayomi</strong> presided on the podium to give the occasion a Christmas-themed message. In his preaching, he highlighted the importance of Christmas and how its essence is reflected in our daily lives, likening Christmas to the human experience of pregnancy. He also explained that Christmas is all about family, neither nuclear nor extended, but the entire family of Christ.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-96ad75f4-8d66-40a3-8603-10ca99a103e5 data-caption="Olu of Warri, Ogiame Atuwatse III hosts inspirational maiden edition of Christmas Carol Service in Warri"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/JYjktkpTURBXy85Nzc0MWMwMDQ2NTdjYTQzN2YyOWI3YzBlNjYzNTBkZi5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAg_Cww></span><p>The Apostle indicated the pivotal role of the Warri Kingdom in Nigeria's overall affairs. He cited prophetically that the Kingdom of Warri was the first place to receive the gospel as far back as the 15th century, and it was from this great Kingdom that the gospel spread throughout the whole of Nigeria. In his words, "The Lord said, I will make Warri a gate again, I will enter through Warri again, and just as I brought Christianity here, I will birth the new Nigeria from this place."</p><p>This followed with another message from Rev. Pastor <strong>Chris Utieyin</strong> <strong>Akperi</strong>, who roused the congregation with a series of prophetic words and said a prayer for the King. Towards the end of his sermon, the Pastor asked the entire congregation to stand on their feet, stretch their hands and pray for the King. He ended with a prophetic word, "…by daybreak things will change for Iwere."</p><p>As a special feature for the night, <strong>Minister Chi</strong>, a guest performer, entertained guests, leading to a fine recession hymn for His Majesty, Ogiame Atuwatse III, which climaxed the event. Several earth-shattering, uplifting solos ensued. This included the standing ovation for the piercing opera notes hit during the solo performance of the song “Oh Holy Night” sung in Itsekiri.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The night ended with the famous "We wish you a Merry Christmas" chant. All the guests sang along excitedly and soon followed the Olu's procession out of the hall to the sight of blaring fireworks displays within the Palace. Guests commended The Monarchy for this initiative and prayed that Olu's reign would remain continuous. Some guests commented about their excitement for the upcoming Saturday event; <strong>the Ghigho Aghofen (The Palace Watch).</strong></p><p>This new initiative of His Majesty, Ogiame Atuwatse III, the Olu of Warri, a keen lover of arts and culture, is part of an intentional effort to open up the Kingdom and aggressively employ tourism as a source of wealth creation and gainful engagement for the people. The Ghigho Aghofen is scheduled to hold every quarter with other communities within the Kingdom taking turns to perform their roles.</p><p>Catch every part of the Christmas Carol event by visiting the YouTube channel, <a href=# id=4fc1222b-fb3b-4950-8c17-f48847f36c54>Olu of Warri Kingdom</a>.</p><p>Let’s bask in the true spirit of Christmas.</p><p>Compliments of the season!</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>#FeaturedPost</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0miknqyipHywuNRmpp9lp5a%2Fs7WMqJ6imZ2aeqLA1LCYrauVYraqtYyhpqyso2K2r7%2FPoqmarJmku6K4jKaYopyVo3qmsMitoKimXaSzbq%2FHq6CsrJ2WwHC90XGuqqqd</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
