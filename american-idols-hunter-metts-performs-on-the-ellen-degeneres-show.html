As it turns out, DeGeneres is a huge fan.</strong></p><p>Metts was eliminated from the competition, along with comeback singer <a href=#>Arthur Gunn</a>, after the Top 7 round of Season 19.

He called Idol a “launchpad” for his career.</p><p>The 22-year-old singer also discussed the disappointment he felt when he previously couldn’t audition for the show due to <a href=#>his sister’s job at Disney</a>. She ended up quitting her job so there would be no conflict, which allowed Metts to audition for the show.</p><p>“When you make it, you owe her big time,” DeGeneres reminded him.</p><p>Hunter’s sister, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Mattie</a>, is apparently now <a href=#>dating American Idol‘s Graham DeFranco</a>, so maybe Hunter has already repaid his sister’s kindness in a way.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>GRAHAM DEFRANCO SHAVES BEARD IN PROTEST OF HUNTER METTS’ ‘IDOL’ ELIMINATION</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-metts-performs-skinny-love-on-the-show>Metts Performs ‘Skinny Love’ on the Show</h3><p>After his interview with DeGeneres, Metts grabbed his guitar and delivered an amazing performance of “Skinny Love” by Bon Iver. DeGeneres stood up to applaud him after he performed, and the audience seemed to love it as well.</p><p>Metts also has a new single out called “20,000 Kisses.” He shared on <a href=# class=broken_link>Instagram</a> that the song made it to Number 1 on the iTunes singer/songwriter charts, and his other songs “The River” and “Loaded Gun” also broke the Top 10. Metts thanked his fans for their support.</p><p>“20,000 Kisses” is a sweet love song:</p><p>“I’ll be there when the curtain’s closing / Lovin’ you with the credits rollin’,” he sings in the chorus. “I’ll be feelin’ higher than the clouds / 20,000 kisses from now.”</p><p>You can follow Metts on <a href=# class=broken_link>Instagram</a> for updates about his career.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=#>WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THE STAR-STUDDED SEASON 19 ‘AMERICAN IDOL’ FINALE</a></strong></p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jenny-McCarthy-Masked-Singer-Jenny-McCarthy-Donnie-Wahlberg-Cluedle-Doo-The-Masked-Singer.jpeg alt="Jenny McCarthy is ‘Ashamed’ She Didn’t Guess Husband Donnie Wahlberg as The Cluedle-Doo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKacq6GTlrtutcOoo6xlmKq7tbHRZqSerKSoerGx0Z%2Bmq6WjYryvedOhnGadnKGyr3nDnp6eppWnsrR50qGmsGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
