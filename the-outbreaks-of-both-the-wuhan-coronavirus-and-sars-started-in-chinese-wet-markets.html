That makes it easy for a virus to jump from animal to human.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>On Wednesday, authorities in Wuhan, China where the current outbreak started banned the trade of live animals at wet markets. The specific market where the outbreak began, the Huanan Seafood Market, was shuttered on January 1. The coronavirus that emerged there has so far killed 17 people and infected nearly 550.</p><p>"When you bring animals together in these unnatural situations, you have the risk of human diseases emerging," Kevin Olival, a disease ecologist and conservationist at the EcoHealth Alliance, <a href=# id=f6cdba5c-1475-31a9-a7cf-4737e3c0e1d2>told National Geographic</a> . "If the animals are housed in bad conditions under a lot of stress, it might create a better opportunity for them to shed virus and to be sick."</p><p>Coronaviruses are zoonotic diseases, meaning they first spread to people from animals. In the case of SARS, and likely this Wuhan coronavirus outbreak as well, bats were the original hosts. The bats then infected other animals, which transmitted the virus to humans.</p><p>Here's what Chinese wet markets look like.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-9>The Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan closed January 1, after it was found to be the most likely starting point for the outbreak of this coronavirus, also called 2019-nCov.</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-8cf3d8f4-7926-3046-a6c6-02206e5efba7 data-caption=" "><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/w0ZktkuTURBXy8xYWQ1N2VlNi0zM2E0LTRjYjctOTU4MS0yMDQ5NzYyMjJmYTIuanBlZ5GVAs0DFs0CFsLD></span><p>NOEL CELIS/AFP via Getty Images</p><p>A 61-year-old man was the first person to die from the virus.
