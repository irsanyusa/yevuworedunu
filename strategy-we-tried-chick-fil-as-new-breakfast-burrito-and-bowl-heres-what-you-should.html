 We grabbed a chicken and a sausage version of both to see if they're worth ordering."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It's actually pretty good as far as fast-food salsas are concerned; it's spicy — you can actually see the red pepper seeds in it — but not crazy hot, and it avoids becoming a watery mess.</p><p>The chicken is as tender as ever. This appears to be Chick-fil-A's chicken nuggets sliced up into smaller, bite-sized pieces. The bowl as a whole is a little disappointing — it doesn’t feel like a cohesive item, merely hash browns, egg, and chicken thrown in the same container with an afterthought of cheese. It needs more cheese, more… something.</p><p>The jalapeño salsa does its best to tie the disparate ingredients together — it’s peppery, but without a scorching heat that upsets your morning.</p><p>The peppery sausage seems to fit the spicy salsa vibe a bit more comfortably here, but the same problems that plague the chicken bowl are still present.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>There's not enough cheese, and the cheese that is there coagulates quickly. The bowl is small, and the pieces feel jumbled together haphazardly. The whole doesn't add up to the sum of its parts.</p><p>The burrito, however, is clearly the right and proper form for this meal. It stays warm, the cheese stays melty, and everything is contained in the strong and humble culinary workhorse known as the tortilla.</p><p>Everything is accessible in one bite: the classically beautiful Chick-fil-A chicken, the soggy yet greasily delicious hash browns, and the egg, which is a slight step above what you usually find in other fast food breakfast items.</p><p>Once again, this far eclipses the bowl version. Everything makes sense cocooned in a warm flour tortilla. The cheese seems cheesy, the sausage flavorful. The hash browns add heft to each bite.</p><p>Chick-fil-A's foray into the wonderful world of bowls is a rocky one, and the bowls themselves leave much to be desired. They feel aimless and slapdash in construction, and they don't keep warm long. But their burrito counterparts bring hope to the breakfast hash brown scramble concoction.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p70q2pmqyVnMZwv9OrmK2dl656uLGMraminZRisKm1wqRkn6GcYq60ec2ermaaopqurLLArKtmmqWnv6rAzmaYp5xdl7y4uIyhnKudo2LEqa3TZrCorV2otbDBy51mo6tgaMSlug%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
