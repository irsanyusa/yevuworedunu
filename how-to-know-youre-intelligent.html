So what does intelligence mean?</p><p><a href=# id=67ce1e7a-8bef-41c4-864a-043287334506 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>An intelligent person</a> is one who is flexible in his thinking and can adapt to changes, and at the same time is able to effectively manage his emotions. In other words, intelligent people, in the light of modern research, have several different types of intelligence, including intellectual, social and emotional intelligence. There is a set of characteristics that distinguish them.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-4>Here are 6 ways of knowing you're an intelligent person:</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-5>1. An intelligent person thinks with his heart</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-12ac748d-fbda-4360-a159-ccb5e29aa738 data-caption="There is a correlation between high emotional intelligence and high IQ [Unsplash]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/GsJktkpTURBXy9jYzhiODk0ODlkYWFhMDU0ZDkwOGIxM2Y5NDAwYzQxNS5qcGeSlQMAAM0D6M0CV5UCzQMWzQHawsM></span><p>For many years, the mind and the heart were treated as opposing forces, and the use of empathy was not equated with the behavior of an intelligent person. However, in light of new research, there is a correlation between high emotional intelligence and high IQ.</p><p>It turns out that the higher the score in the empathy traits, the higher the score in the traits of effective verbal understanding. In other words, empathy, which is part of emotional intelligence, and understanding, which is part of cognitive intelligence, are directly related. So if you follow your heart, there is a good chance you also follow your head.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-9>2. An intelligent person is curious about the world</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>It's easy to assume that highly intelligent people enjoy reading. But being intelligent is not about being able to read many books a day. It's about curiosity about everything and a constant desire to learn. Intelligent people like to learn about other people, cultures, animals, history, basically the whole world. While a love of reading isn't necessarily a sign of intelligence, it shows that you enjoy learning and are curious, which are the hallmarks of an intelligent person.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-11>3. An intelligent person is a good observer</h3></p><p>The smartest person in the room is not always the loudest. Instead of bragging about their achievements, an intelligent person is usually quiet and observant. The ability to observe calmly allows you to notice things that others miss, such as subtle patterns of behavior that allow you to draw valid conclusions about other people.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-13>4. An intelligent person has good self-control</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-e72997f1-29c1-4f28-9a98-8a7cf3d8d762 data-caption="Self-control shows you think more often before you speak or act [iStock]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/8yyktkpTURBXy9jOTc2NDUwYjMzNjUzOGRlNzM3N2FhNTFlMmMxMDI2MS5qcGeSlQMAAM0CZM0BmJUCzQJkzQGYwsM></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Having self-control means you are mature. You know how to control your emotions and impulses so that they do no harm. Self-control is a sign of intelligence because it means you think more often before you speak or act.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-16>5. An intelligent person knows that he has limitations</h3></p><p>Highly intelligent people do not try to act as if they know everything. In fact, a sign of intelligence is recognising that you don't know everything. An intelligent person knows his limitations and is able to admit them. This allows you to be constantly open to new situations and learn more and more.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-18>6. An intelligent person is flexible</h3></p><p>The smartest people don't waste time worrying about things they can't control. If you know how to be flexible and go with the flow, chances are you are highly intelligent. Instead of rigidly sticking to a predetermined plan, intelligent people remain mentally flexible, open, and can easily adapt to life, no matter what comes their way. Such flexibility shows that you can solve problems and quickly find a way out of situations.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This article was originally published on <a href=# id=ee057679-450f-40ce-a186-afafd26159c9 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>Onet Woman</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLWww4ytpmajnqTEbsXOrqmeZZmjwaa4y6KenqakZIG5uZWmp20%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
