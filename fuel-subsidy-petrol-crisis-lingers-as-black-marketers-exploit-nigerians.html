The prominent narrative about the policy is anchored on the sentiment that the scheme benefits a few oil magnates who buy petrol at a subsidised rate from Nigeria and sell the product abroad.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>It is against this background that Nigerians subscribed to the initiative without the pushback that the administration of former President <strong>Goodluck Jonathan</strong> witnessed when it made the same move in 2012.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-d4bcb6c3-47cd-4aa9-aaeb-76ef178d5fe5 data-caption="Former President, Goodluck Jonathan (Thisday)"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/WEfktkpTURBXy9jNzgzOWVkYTRlODg5YzNkNjRiYzJlNzZhYWQ0YWZjOS5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAjLCww></span><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-8>Fuel subsidy controversy</h3></p><p>In October 2023, during another fuel scarcity episode, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria disclosed that fuel subsidy had been reintroduced through the back door but the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL) denied the claim.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The Group Chief Executive Officer, NNPCL, <strong>Mele Kyari</strong>, while explaining the reason for the fuel crisis, re-echoed Tinubu’s position that fuel subsidy is truly gone.</p><p>“No subsidy whatsoever. We are recovering our full cost from the products that we import. We sell to the market, and we understand why the marketers are unable to import. We hope that they do it very quickly and these are some of the interventions the government is doing. There is no subsidy,” Kyari said.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-05243db0-a8a9-45f1-82a8-c92999b24227 data-caption="Mele Kyari, chief executive officer of NNPC Co. Ltd.

They are subsidising products as we speak.</p><p>“They are spending billions of naira to subsidise products, and because they know that this country may go on fire if Nigerians buy products at about ₦1,000/litre, they keep twisting facts.”</p><p>According to the Major Energies Marketers Association of Nigeria, the landing cost of PMS as of July 16, 2024, was ₦1,117/litre.</p><p>This suggests the official pump price of PMS across the country should be over ₦1,000 if the price is not subsidised.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>However, every time Nigerians are faced with a fuel crisis, the situation usually leaves room for boys on the streets to turn to black marketers, selling petrol to people who want it in their vehicles to move around or power their generators.</p><p>The lingering petrol crisis in Nigeria often leaves Nigerians at the mercy of black marketers who not only sell the product at exorbitant prices but also mix petrol with other liquid that damages vehicle engines.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-060c4202-6959-450b-8555-00836755a466 data-caption="Fuel peddlers hawking petrol in jerrycans in Abuja.

The corporation threatened to withdraw the licence of any fuel stations that attend to fuel peddlers.</p><p>While this directive gives vehicle owners access to petrol, Nigerians, such as artisans who need the product for their trades are left with no choice but to patronise the Shylock on the streets who regardless of the NNPC directive would get the product by any possible means.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-26>Subsidy or shortfall?</h3></p><p>Meanwhile, after almost a year of denying the return of fuel subsidy, the NNPC has eventually clarified that the government has been making payments to keep the official price of petrol at ₦617/litre at fuel stations operated by the NNPC. But these payments are not called subsidy.</p><p>While clarifying this on Monday, July 19, 2024, the Chief Financial Officer of the NNPC,<strong> Alhaji Umar Ajiya, </strong>said the <a href=# id=d16cfa78-d6b1-464d-bcfc-59a1da2b5047 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>NNPC has not paid any oil marketer a dime</a> in the name of subsidy in the last eight months.</p><p>He, however, disclosed that the government has been paying for what he called a ‘shortfall.’</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“No marketer has received any money from us by way of subsidy.</p><p>“What has been happening is that we have been importing PMS, which has been landing at a certain cost price and the government tells us to sell it at half price.</p><p>“So the difference between the landing price and that half price is a shortfall," Ajiya said.</p><p>While the petrol crisis lingers, Nigerians look forward to President Tinubu’s promise to revive the local refineries and address the country’s dependence on fuel importation, which is believed to be one of the causes of the persistent fuel crisis in Nigeria.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0mijqJuRoXynwcSlZKytkqi2pcWMqZytqp%2BheqS%2ByKygrGWcnruosdGsZJqrXZe5oq%2FKZqSaqpuawaa%2B0macsaicpLa1ec2inp6qmZa7tHvYbXBuaZKt</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
