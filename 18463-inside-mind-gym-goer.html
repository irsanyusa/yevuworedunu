Indeed, our latest data suggest that 12% describe themselves as ‘gym goers’. But what is it that sets fitness fanatics apart from the population at large?</p><p>Using YouGov Profiles I have assessed the motivations and mentality of people who are gym members.

While making time for exercise is obviously key to this group, half (51%) are willing to sacrifice their spare time in order to get ahead at work (compared to 40% of the population as a whole). Furthermore, four in ten (38%) are more motived by their own career progression than money (against 29% of the British public).</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/gym20goer.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Tied to this, fitness fanatics tend to be assertive in the workplace, applying their will to situations and colleagues. Over seven in ten (74%) say they don’t like being told what to do, while 39% believe they can usually get people to see an issue their way (compared to 33% of the public).</p><p>Furthermore, they are more likely to have a streak of steel in them, 35% don’t being ruthless to get where they want. In terms of specific personality traits, approaching a fifth (17%) of gym-goers describe themselves as ‘independent’ (as against 12%), while 15% believe they are ‘strong-willed’ (vs. 12%).</p><p><strong>What does this mean for brands?</strong></p><p>Allied to being driven in their careers, fitness fanatics are also more likely to be a disciplined group – and this matters to any brands looking to target them. Regular gym-goers focus on a particular product they want to buy, with over seven in ten (74%) saying they save up for things that they want (against 66% of GB public).</p><p>However, being such disciplined consumers means they can be difficult to target. Two thirds of fitness fans (66%) feel they are bombarded by advertising. Half (53%) many feel that adverts are ‘a waste of time’.</p><p>Social media therefore, is the effective medium for any ad efforts; over half say that online is the most effective advertising channel. A quarter (27%) of gym member engage with adverts on social media rather than on regular websites (compared to 20% of the general population).</p><p>So while getting through to the group is tough, if a brand is able to fit its messaging to fit in with this group’s personality and ambitions, it will be well placed.</p><p>Image iStock</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYW2Bd3%2BMoqWsoZSaeq61zZ1koLGdYrSwsdE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
