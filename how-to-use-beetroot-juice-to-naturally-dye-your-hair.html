This red vegetable contains betacyanins, a type of betalains, which contribute to their deep red color.</p><p>Beetroots are packed with nourishing vitamins, minerals, flavonoids, and antioxidants like carotenoids is a natural remedy for improving hair health and hair growth. It also offers incredible benefits for hair health when applied directly to the hair.</p><p>Here are 3 DIY Beetroot dye recipes you can try at home.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>1. Beetroot mixed with coconut or olive oil</strong></p><p>The nourishing properties of coconut and olive oil when mixed with beetroot can enhance your hair color and hydrate your hair at the same time. Its moisturizing and hydrating properties can also help make your hair glossy and shiny when you wash your hair after the application of beet hair dye.</p><p>How to use:</p><p>∙ Cut the beetroot into pieces then wrap the pieces in aluminum foil and bake them for 30 minutes at 200 degrees centigrade. Blend the baked beets to extract the juice. ∙ Mix 3 tablespoons of virgin coconut or olive oil into the extracted beet juice. ∙ Wear plastic gloves and apply the above mixture over your hair.
