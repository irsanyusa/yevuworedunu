As families struggled to regain their financial footing amid the pandemic and removal of the monthly payment cushion, support for congressional Democrats fell in February and April among voters who received the payments.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Critics noted that the Inflation Reduction Act, passed in August, marked yet another <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>instance</a> of family and child care policies’ being left on the cutting-room floor, despite majority support among all voters. In a <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>July survey</a>, about 3 in 5 voters said they backed a renewal of the monthly child tax credit payments.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">This support is not lost on lawmakers on the left, who are renewing a push to move such policies past the finish line by year-end. Vice President Kamala Harris <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>told</a> the Congressional Black Caucus this month that the administration is “working like hell to make sure we make the Child Tax Credit permanent.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Sen.

Mitt Romney (R-Utah) about the possibility of reviving the credit had made little progress.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Progressive groups have also called on lawmakers to make good on their promises to support families.
