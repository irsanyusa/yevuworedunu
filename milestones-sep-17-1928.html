Ruth Elder, famed aviatrix; by Lyle Womack, of Balboa, C. Z. Aviatrix Elder has been appearing in vaudeville throughout the U. S. and cinemacting in support of two aged parents and five brothers. Husband Womack, in Central America, charged cruelty, said, “weight has been reduced, efficiency for work lessened and health and reason endangered.” On her return from the trans-Atlantic flight she refused him the connubial salute, said “Don’t be a fool.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Slain. Elizabeth, Countess Fischler von Treuberg, 58, famed European adventuress; by Edgar Beese, German flier, who committed suicide at the same time; in Berlin. Born in 1870, a tailor’s daughter, Elizabeth Uhl became a wealthy, fashionable courtesan, celebrated in Continental capitals and on the Riviera. In 1911 she won long-sought social standing by her marriage to Count von Treuberg, a bankrupt naval officer. She had arranged to pay him 25,000 marks, but never did so and the marriage was later annulled. Aviator Beese’s father, mother and sister all were suicides before him.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Died.

Robert Hawley Ingersoll, 68, originator of the dollar watch; of Bright’s disease; in Denver, Colo. It is estimated that over 70,000,000 Ingersoll watches have been manufactured. Wartime conditions made the dollar watch an impossibility; in 1921 the Ingersoll brothers became bankrupt; their factory has since been purchased by the Waterbury Clock Co.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Died. Mrs. Marie Hungerford Mackay, 85, “the untitled Duchess,” relict of John W. Mackay (Croesus of mines & cables), mother of Clarence H. Mackay (president of Postal Telegraph Co.); of heart disease in Roslyn, L. I., N. W. Born in Brooklyn, N. Y., the daughter of Civil and Mexican war veteran Col. Daniel C. Hungerford and his onetime Parisian wife, it was she who in the early ’60s braved a squalid, vulgar Nevada mining town with her first husband, one Dr. Bryant. After his death she kept a boarding house in the mining camps. To her table came John W. Mackay, Irish immigrant miner. They were married. The famed Comstock Lode, in the opening of which he was an entrepreneur, yielded $300,000,000 in gold and silver within six years. Buttressed with wealth, Mrs. Mackay assailed San Francisco society, made but slight impress. She traveled to France. There her dark beauty, wit, enviable taste and prodigious fortune made her a social enchantress. Speaking flawless French, acquired from her mother, she was received in the almost impenetrable salons of the Faubourg St. Germain in Paris. Her Nevada brand of horsemanship, exhibited in the Bois du Boulogne, was the despair of French equestriennes. Meissonier painted her portrait. Ludovic Halevy portrayed her in L’Abbe Constantin, the novel which won him a seat among the “40 Immortals” of the French Academy. While Mr. Mackay remained in the U. S., she crossed the Channel to London, repeated her triumphs. Her mansion on Carlton House Terrace was decorated with Gobelin tapestries, other valuable objets d’art. Edward VII, then Prince of Wales, was a constant, admiring visitor. She went to Moscow, where Tsar Alexander III pronounced her the most beautifully dressed woman at his coronation ball. In 1902 her husband died. In 1915 she began a quiet life at Nice, France. She returned to the U. S. in 1919, where she has since entertained the present Prince of Wales and Colonel Lindbergh on Long Island.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Her lifelong gifts to charity were noteworthy, including $300,000 which she gave with Clarence W. Mackay to the University of Nevada. One of the three grandchildren present at her dea.th was Mrs. Irving Berlin (Ellin Mackay), whose marriage to the Tin Pan alley tycoon led to an estrangement from her father.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Died. The Rev. Joseph C. Hartzell, 86, onetime Methodist Episcopal Bishop of Africa, who during 46 years of church service averaged 35,000 miles of travel per year, never having an accident; from injuries inflicted by house-breakers on-June 1; in Cincinnati.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9vb2lhbn9wucilnKysn6OytHnSnqdmaWdifnp%2Bl2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
