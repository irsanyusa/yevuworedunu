Falcone was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>intimidated</a> by&nbsp;McCarthy’s gothic appearance, as&nbsp;she was dressed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;black cape, had blue hair, and looked “very, very goth.” As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, they did not communicate. However, fate brought them together again ten years later at&nbsp;The Groundlings school in&nbsp;Los Angeles, and McCarthy remembers that they became close friends right from the beginning. “We&nbsp;were friends from, like, day one,” the actress recalls.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dd7/865/068e06544bb233b740e0d17e74.jpg><p>Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> the screen in&nbsp;a&nbsp;2003 episode of&nbsp;the popular television series <i>Gilmore Girls</i>. While the exact date of&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;their romantic relationship is&nbsp;unknown, they exchanged vows in&nbsp;2005.</p><p>Falcone <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>regards</a> himself and McCarthy as&nbsp;fortunate to&nbsp;have each other, “We&nbsp;got hit with the same lucky stick. From the very first time we&nbsp;spoke, we&nbsp;were on&nbsp;the same page. <strong>We&nbsp;love each other, respect each other, and try not to&nbsp;sweat the small stuff</strong>. And we&nbsp;make each other laugh.”</p><p>In&nbsp;January 2007, the actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>announced</a> that they were having their first baby. She joked that she hoped the baby would inherit more of&nbsp;Ben’s calm traits and less of&nbsp;her own nervous ones. Their daughter, Vivian, was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>born</a> in&nbsp;May of&nbsp;that year, and McCarthy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a> that Vivian looks a&nbsp;lot like her.&nbsp;3&nbsp;years later, they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>had</a> their second daughter, Georgette.</p><p>After giving birth to&nbsp;their second child, the 39-year-old actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> that she had been completely exhausted during the pregnancy. She explained that she had been sleeping only 3.5-4 hours a&nbsp;day, which had been very challenging for her, “I’m super round and super tired. My&nbsp;husband says it’s like he’s <a href=# title=married data-link=tag>married</a> to&nbsp;a&nbsp;90-year-old because&nbsp;I just go&nbsp;out mid-sentence. He&nbsp;says, ‘You were in&nbsp;mid-thought, and then the next thing you stop talking. I&nbsp;turn around, and you’re sound asleep on&nbsp;the couch.’”<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d5c/c36/6d4c3e5848a5fca57207a43b6f.jpg><p>LFI / Photoshot / REPORTER / East News</p><p>Although Melissa and Ben faced challenges as&nbsp;parents, they did not forget about their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>careers</a> in&nbsp;acting. In&nbsp;2011, they co-starred in&nbsp;the comedy movie <i>Bridesmaids</i>. McCarthy’s performance in&nbsp;the film earned her an&nbsp;Oscar nomination, although she ultimately lost to&nbsp;Octavia Spencer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/932/090/f3036b557d9c89056a9b0e0347.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2013, Melissa and Ben embarked on&nbsp;a&nbsp;new project together by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>founding</a> a&nbsp;production company. The following year, they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a> the script for the movie <i>Tammy</i>. Melissa was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>happy</a> they took this step, “We’ve been writing together for longer than we’ve been married. To&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;produce our own work and other people’s work that we&nbsp;are so&nbsp;passionate about is&nbsp;really a&nbsp;dream come true.”</p><p>Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone support each other in&nbsp;every aspect. In&nbsp;2017, Falcone <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a> a&nbsp;book named <i>Being a&nbsp;Dad Is&nbsp;Weird: Lessons in&nbsp;Fatherhood from My&nbsp;<a href=# title=Family data-link=tag>Family</a> to&nbsp;Yours</i>, and McCarthy wrote the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>introduction</a> to&nbsp;the book.</p><p>The couple <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>enjoys</a> working together and loves to&nbsp;collaborate on&nbsp;projects. When McCarthy was asked about working with her husband on&nbsp;movies, she responded, “It’s like you get to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;work with your best friend.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b72/d41/ab28325e12b6ee17506905956d.jpg><p>Despite being together for many years, Melissa and Ben continue to&nbsp;surprise each other. For Valentine’s Day, McCarthy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>gave</a> Falcone a&nbsp;heart-shaped box filled with deviled eggs, knowing he&nbsp;loves them more than chocolate.</p><p>And for their 13th wedding anniversary, Melissa gifted her husband a&nbsp;cell phone designed for seniors with oversized buttons, which horrified their daughters. Nonetheless, the couple continues to&nbsp;find joy in&nbsp;making each other laugh and bringing happiness to&nbsp;their relationship. “He&nbsp;gave me&nbsp;2&nbsp;beautiful rings, one that said ‘Love.’ And I&nbsp;gave him a&nbsp;Jitterbug phone. I&nbsp;need to&nbsp;work on&nbsp;my&nbsp;romance skills,” Melissa <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6cf/20a/7952b4509e9ab2e18982225ebb.jpg><p>The couple marked their 15th wedding anniversary in&nbsp;2020, and just before the occasion, Melissa <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview that meeting her husband was like winning the lottery, saying, “I&nbsp;hit the jackpot.” She also mentioned that a&nbsp;key element of&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong relationship is&nbsp;making each other laugh. “<strong>He&nbsp;makes me&nbsp;gut-laugh, like crazy gut-laugh, 4&nbsp;or 5&nbsp;times a&nbsp;day</strong>,” she added.</p><p>Ben Falcone <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>agrees</a> with his wife, stating that humor can make a&nbsp;huge difference. “<strong>Melissa makes everything fun&nbsp;— just by&nbsp;being herself</strong>. I’m so&nbsp;fortunate to&nbsp;be&nbsp;married to&nbsp;someone who is&nbsp;smart, kind, beautiful, and crazy funny.”</p><p>However, humor is&nbsp;not the only factor contributing to&nbsp;a&nbsp;happy marriage.
