If that sounds unlikely then it’s probably why “Titanique” has been such a resounding success. The laugh-out-loud show is both a parody of James Cameron’s 11-time Oscar-winning 1997 mega-film “Titanic” and a loving salute to Canadian singer Dion who, as a character in the piece, delivers her version of the story of Jack and Rose, via a shipload of her hits including “My Heart Will Go On,” “All By Myself,” and “To Love You More,” backed by a full live band."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

(The production moved to the larger Daryl Roth Theater in November of that year.)</span></p><p></p><p><span>Co-written by Tye Blue, Marla Mindelle </span><span>(“Sister Act</span><span>,”)</span><span>&nbsp;and Constantine Rousouli </span><span>(“Cruel Intentions,” “Hairspray”)</span><span>, “</span><span>Titanique”</span><span> is also directed by Blue (“</span><span>RuPaul’s Drag Race”</span><span>) and choreographed by Ellenore Scott (“</span><span>Funny Girl,” “Little Shop of Horrors”</span><span>), with music supervision, arrangements, and orchestrations by Nicholas James Connell.</span></p><p><span>“I think ‘</span><span>Titanique’</span><span>&nbsp;is a hit because it’s really, really funny. There’s a casual queerness to it, which people are living for,” Blue explained to </span><span>Out Magazine</span><span> back in January.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“And the comedy and the jokes set it apart from other jukebox musicals, like the ones on Broadway right now. We also have one of the best catalogues of songs on the planet mixed with one of the most beloved movies on the planet. It’s just a strong concept.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images-r2.thebrag.com/var/uploads/2024/08/0110_Michael-Williams-Nicole-Parker-and-Lindsay-Heather-Pearce-in-TITANIQUE-c-Evan-Zimmerman-for-MurphyMade-2.jpg><p><span>“Titanique”</span><span> is also set to open in Chicago, Toronto, Montreal and London’s West End, but its exclusive Sydney docking will mark the production’s international debut with support from the NSW Government via its events agency, Destination NSW.</span></p><p><span>The Australian cast has just been announced, with music/theatre/cabaret triple threat Marney McQueen </span><span>(“Hairspray”)</span><span> starring as The Queen of Power Ballads herself, Dion.
