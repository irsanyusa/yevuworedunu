The woman is&nbsp;engaged with the <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> of&nbsp;her life, and she’s so&nbsp;happy in&nbsp;her relationship, but there’s a&nbsp;thing that significantly spoiled her life. Melissa has recently had an&nbsp;explicit conversation with her future mother-in-law, who shared some details about her son’s past, which the future bride just cannot come to&nbsp;terms with. The woman shared her <a href=# title=story data-link=tag>story</a> with&nbsp;us and she wants some really good advice from our readers because she doesn’t know what to&nbsp;do&nbsp;about the unwanted truth that has been opened up&nbsp;to&nbsp;her.</p><p><h2>Melissa has a&nbsp;painful experience from the past, which led to&nbsp;her having PTSD.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dd5/5ba/2977c85305a0fe7c6f137c832d.jpg><p>Melissa is&nbsp;a&nbsp;33-year-old woman, who has gone through very turbulent times in&nbsp;her life. Now that the woman finally found her <a href=# title=happiness data-link=tag>happiness</a>, she seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;losing it&nbsp;again, this time because of&nbsp;her accidental revelation about her fiancé. The woman penned an&nbsp;emotional letter and shared her story with&nbsp;us. All she wanted was a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;advice from people who wouldn’t remain indifferent to&nbsp;her mental suffering and her struggle. The woman sincerely believes that no&nbsp;one can help her as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;a&nbsp;person, who would feel her situation like their own.</p><p>The woman opened her letter, saying, “Well, it&nbsp;seems like my&nbsp;life is&nbsp;crashing again, and&nbsp;I still can’t believe that this is&nbsp;happening to&nbsp;me&nbsp;for the second time already. I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;very traumatic experience from my&nbsp;past relationship, which was full of&nbsp;narcissism, toxic attitude, and infidelity. I&nbsp;barely survived after a&nbsp;very painful breakup and my&nbsp;now-fiancé, Michael, was the person who helped me&nbsp;to&nbsp;heal.</p><p>Michael and&nbsp;I met 4&nbsp;years ago. We&nbsp;didn’t fall in&nbsp;love instantly, but we&nbsp;did feel a&nbsp;strong and mutual attraction towards each other. Love came later, when we&nbsp;gradually discovered the best sides of&nbsp;each other’s personalities and when our bond grew so&nbsp;close that we&nbsp;couldn’t spend a&nbsp;single day without each other.”</p><p><h2>Melissa could only wish for such a&nbsp;partner like Michael to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;her life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d36/042/750b0e5f33b9df61621b998905.jpg><p>Melissa shared, “My&nbsp;partner Michael is&nbsp;everything&nbsp;I want in&nbsp;a&nbsp;man, he’s kind, caring, and open. He’s emotionally available and stable. He’s done nothing but show up&nbsp;for&nbsp;me. And he&nbsp;makes me&nbsp;feel like a&nbsp;better person. And worthy.</p><p>No&nbsp;wonder that when we&nbsp;got engaged, this was the peak of&nbsp;happiness for&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;was building up&nbsp;plans for our future and&nbsp;I was living by&nbsp;the thought that bad times in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life are over and only the best things are waiting ahead. I&nbsp;wanted our own house, I&nbsp;wanted many <a href=# title=kids data-link=tag>kids</a>, I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;live my&nbsp;whole life and spend all my&nbsp;time with Michael. And this was mutual, he&nbsp;was on&nbsp;cloud nine, too.</p><p>I&nbsp;knew that our relationship meant a&nbsp;lot to&nbsp;Michael. His previous marriage was unhappy, too. But he&nbsp;did part ways with his ex&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very civil way, or&nbsp;so&nbsp;I was told. I&nbsp;sincerely believed everything that he&nbsp;told&nbsp;me, and only now do&nbsp;I understand that&nbsp;I shouldn’t have. The ugly truth about my&nbsp;future husband and the love of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life was unveiled accidentally. All bad things happen like this, when you’re the happiest person on&nbsp;Earth and when you don’t expect anything bad to&nbsp;happen when you’re unprepared.”</p><p><h2>Melissa found our Michaels’ ugly secret right before starting their wedding arrangements.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1ed/303/aa95c35694918072438017a36e.jpg><p>Melissa revealed, “I&nbsp;should mention that my&nbsp;relationship with my&nbsp;future in-laws is&nbsp;very warm and cordial. More than that, they both treat me&nbsp;like their own daughter. I&nbsp;once noticed that my&nbsp;future MIL, Stephanie, was very skeptical about our engagement and marriage. When I&nbsp;asked her why she was reacting like that, she hugged me&nbsp;tight and didn’t say a&nbsp;word. I&nbsp;thought it&nbsp;was my&nbsp;misunderstanding of&nbsp;her real emotions and&nbsp;I never raised this topic again.</p><p>Recently, I&nbsp;was sitting on&nbsp;our terrace drinking my&nbsp;morning coffee, when&nbsp;I had a&nbsp;call from Stephanie, who asked me&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very worried voice if&nbsp;Michael was around. I&nbsp;said&nbsp;no, he&nbsp;was at&nbsp;work as&nbsp;usual, and Stephanie then asked me&nbsp;if&nbsp;she could come in&nbsp;10&nbsp;minutes. She said she had an&nbsp;urgent thing to&nbsp;discuss with me&nbsp;before our wedding and that the right time was now or&nbsp;never. I&nbsp;said that sure, she could come. And she arrived very quickly.</p><p>She sat me&nbsp;down in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;herself, and looking straight into my&nbsp;eyes she started speaking. She asked me&nbsp;not to&nbsp;interfere with her because she was going to&nbsp;share something hard for her. But she was convinced that&nbsp;I needed to&nbsp;know this. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;listened and&nbsp;I almost fainted as&nbsp;I was slowly revealing the details about Michael’s past.”</p><p><h2>The truth hit the woman hard.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eab/5fa/a314e25e0fabc0cec81f5a76c8.jpg><p>Melissa shared, “I&nbsp;found out that about 8&nbsp;years ago, Michael cheated on&nbsp;his ex-wife. She forgave him and they both worked hard to&nbsp;restore their marriage. His ex&nbsp;was pregnant when Michael cheated on&nbsp;her again. She lost the baby and Michael did nothing to&nbsp;even support her after everything that happened with this poor woman. Their marriage was over and Michael has never taken responsibility for his actions.</p><p>What was even more, Michael cheated on&nbsp;the woman he&nbsp;cheated on&nbsp;his ex&nbsp;with. It&nbsp;sounds like such a&nbsp;mess, but for&nbsp;me, it&nbsp;was obvious that something was very very wrong with my&nbsp;beloved man.</p><p>Now, I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;run away from him and&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;right during our wedding ceremony. I&nbsp;love him dearly, but&nbsp;I feel like an&nbsp;idiot to&nbsp;stay with a&nbsp;man who is&nbsp;capable of&nbsp;such things. I&nbsp;feel like I’m a&nbsp;smart woman and&nbsp;I should not believe that my&nbsp;fiancé won’t do&nbsp;this to&nbsp;me, too. There’s a&nbsp;stock of&nbsp;red flags already, which&nbsp;I mustn’t ignore.</p><p>I&nbsp;also feel like it’s so&nbsp;unfair to&nbsp;leave someone I&nbsp;love, who loves&nbsp;me. This is&nbsp;now my&nbsp;inner struggle and my&nbsp;burden to&nbsp;bear. I&nbsp;don’t know what to&nbsp;do. What Michael did is&nbsp;a&nbsp;serious lack of&nbsp;morals. Do&nbsp;you think he&nbsp;can change for the sake of&nbsp;our love or&nbsp;shall&nbsp;I break up&nbsp;with him and run away?”</p><p>And here’s a&nbsp;story of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman, whose husband turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;very creepy person.
