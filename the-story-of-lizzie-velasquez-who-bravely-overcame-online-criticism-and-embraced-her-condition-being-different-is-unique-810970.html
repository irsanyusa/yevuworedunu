She was diagnosed with a rare health condition as a child. 
Born in Austin, Texas, Lizzie Velasquez was diagnosed with a rare condition, neonatal progeroid syndrome, which prevented her from gaining weight and affected her eyes, bones, and heart."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Lizzie didn’t <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>realize</a> she was different in&nbsp;any way from anyone else since her parents never treated her any differently. “They loved me&nbsp;in&nbsp;the face of&nbsp;so&nbsp;many unknowns.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ce2/eba/e3a9795254a996106b5eee959c.jpg><p>She only realized she was different when children in&nbsp;kindergarten appeared scared of&nbsp;her, but Lizzie says her parents supported her through her tough times, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “There is&nbsp;nothing wrong with you, you are just smaller than the other kids. You are beautiful and smart and can accomplish anything.” Eventually, by&nbsp;the time Lizzie was in&nbsp;high school, she became more confident and outgoing and found herself being more positive.</p><p><h2>She found herself becoming a&nbsp;target for online hate at&nbsp;just 17.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/762/f88/f427a15cbaacec8a5c916c1a0a.jpg><p>However, in&nbsp;2006, when Lizzie was&nbsp;17, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>found</a> a&nbsp;YouTube video referring to&nbsp;herself as&nbsp;“The World’s Ugliest Woman” with over 4&nbsp;million views and many negative comments. Lizzie, who had become more confident at&nbsp;the time, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>felt</a> that “within 2&nbsp;seconds, everything that&nbsp;I had worked for up&nbsp;to&nbsp;that point was just sort of&nbsp;knocked over and done.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ebc/e2e/40b8315fe79e050bd8656c06a7.jpg><p>At&nbsp;first, Lizzie was distressed by&nbsp;the onslaught of&nbsp;<a href=# title=criticism data-link=tag>criticism</a> she received. But as&nbsp;she later realized, the video changed her life forever. “I&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;retaliate&nbsp;— it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;waste of&nbsp;time. I&nbsp;just wanted to&nbsp;prove them wrong.” Once she had her mind set on&nbsp;this goal, Lizzie used this moment to&nbsp;redefine her life completely.</p><p><h2>She didn’t let the criticism get to&nbsp;her and instead used her platform for good.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9d0/b1a/0028d256ac8108b7c5e7efb024.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2013, Lizzie gave a&nbsp;TEDx talk in&nbsp;Austin about her experience with online hate in&nbsp;an&nbsp;attempt to&nbsp;raise awareness.
