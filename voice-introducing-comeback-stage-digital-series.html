Specifically, she mentioned a digital series the show will be starting called “The Comeback Stage.” This new series will give artists who did not turn a chair a second chance! Let’s take a look at what we know so far.</strong></p><p>The basic rundown of “The Comeback Stage” is this: six artists who had a Blind Audition but were unable to turn a chair will be coached by a “fifth coach” digitally. (There’s no word on who that coach will be yet. But considering this is The Voice, expectations are high!) Then, the singers will have the chance to join the show for the live rounds. It has not been clarified if just one winner from the six will join at that time or multiple people.</p><p>No matter how these details play out, this is a huge game changer for The Voice! While the show has done similar things on digital, like “The Voice on Snapchat,” they haven’t directly affected the show. Yes, Ignatious Carmouche made it onto Team Adam after winning “The Voice on Snapchat” but he didn’t advance past the Battles. Up until now, these digital efforts haven’t made a big impact on the actual broadcast of the show.</p><p><a href=#>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R75cRXSs8A</a></p><p>The fact that “The Comeback Stage” will bring contestants back into the mix at the live playoffs is crazy! From the details we have so far, it seems that they’ll be able to skip the Battles and Knockouts. This feels like a huge advantage for someone who didn’t turn any chairs! Plus, they’ll get time working with the “fifth coach.” Producers will also have to be careful not to take away from the hard work being done on the televised show.</p><p>Many past finalists and winners have talked openly about how they auditioned multiple times before they made it far in the process. <a href=#>Brynn Cartelli</a>, Season 14’s winner, did not turn a chair her first time auditioning in 2017. <a href=#>Jordan Smith</a> has also talked about how he had to audition a few times before eventually winning the trophy. And <a href=#>Maddie Poppe</a>, last season’s American Idol winner, also failed to turn any chairs on The Voice. Could this new effort be a response to letting such talented people fall through the cracks?</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/thevoice-maddie.jpg alt width=634 height=550 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>It’s an interesting concept because on top of all the logistics, they will just be adding more artists into a show that already has so many. Instead of the usual 48 singers, now there will be 54 this season. It’ll be hard to keep up, that’s for sure. Even at the live playoffs, 20-24 singers are usually left in the competition. And wouldn’t you rather bring an artist back who made it to the Battles or Knockouts? But I guess it’s all about watching the singers’ growth on digital to build up their talent and confidence. Either way, for the artists on “The Comeback Stage,” this is the second chance opportunity of a lifetime!</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/yd.png alt="Here’s What’s In Store Next Week On ‘America’s Got Talent’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the voice usa</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571aignJ1dnru1vs6drJyhnpx6pLvMnpmam5tiwLWtxp5knaGXnsGiuIysnKuhlah8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
