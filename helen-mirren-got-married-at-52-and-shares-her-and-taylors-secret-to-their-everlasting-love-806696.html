Helen Mirren and film director Taylor Hackford <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>met</a> after her breakthrough role in&nbsp;the 1980s film <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Long Good Friday</i></a><i>. </i>He&nbsp;later invited Helen to&nbsp;audition for the movie he&nbsp;was directing, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>White Nights</i></a>, in&nbsp;1986.</p><p>Helen was 38&nbsp;years old at&nbsp;the time she met Taylor. When asked if&nbsp;he&nbsp;is&nbsp;the love of&nbsp;her life, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>actress</a> responded, “I&nbsp;don’t have much life left, do&nbsp;I? So, <strong>I&nbsp;hope he’s the love of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life</strong>.” “The great thing about finding a&nbsp;partnership <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>later</a>&nbsp;on [in&nbsp;life] is&nbsp;that you recognize it&nbsp;as&nbsp;such,” she said. “You recognize the partnership level of&nbsp;this relationship as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;the love and the lust and all the rest of&nbsp;it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/036/fe4/39eb3a59a6af2d2d87c39f7752.jpg><p>After 11&nbsp;years of&nbsp;dating, they officially became a&nbsp;couple and finally tied the knot in&nbsp;1997. They got <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>married</a> because, in&nbsp;the end, they realized they were going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;together forever&nbsp;— legal reasons played an&nbsp;important part in&nbsp;this decision too. Helen shared, “<strong>I&nbsp;always said&nbsp;I have nothing against <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>,</strong> it&nbsp;just wasn’t to&nbsp;my&nbsp;taste, like turnips. It&nbsp;took me&nbsp;a&nbsp;very long time to&nbsp;come round to&nbsp;acquiring the taste. <strong>I&nbsp;just had to&nbsp;meet the right turnip.</strong>”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/31f/d7f/a39ab255b9a75c046789dbe8cf.jpg><p><h2>Helen and Taylor prove you don’t have to&nbsp;believe in&nbsp;romance to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;marriage work.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5ef/f86/cc0fdd5f45b25167265bc8a6f1.jpg><p>The actress stated that they are not <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>romantic</a> with each other and they often forget to&nbsp;get each other birthday presents. Instead of&nbsp;lavishing each other with gifts,<strong> they believe being considerate with each other every day is&nbsp;more important.</strong></p><p>Helen Mirren was never the woman who wanted to&nbsp;wear “the wedding dress.” “As&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor, you don’t need that because you’ve worn the dress. You’ve stood in&nbsp;the spotlight. You’ve had everyone looking at&nbsp;you. And on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;that, for a&nbsp;long time, I&nbsp;just didn’t see the point of&nbsp;marriage.”</p><p>The secret to&nbsp;making their partnership work, according to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Helen</a>, is&nbsp;the fact that, because of&nbsp;their work, they are always <a href=# title=traveling data-link=tag>traveling</a>. “My&nbsp;theory has always been that this is&nbsp;why we’re still together: <strong>because we’ve spent so&nbsp;much time apart, we’re always pleased to&nbsp;see each other.</strong>”</p><p><h2>Helen Mirren and her husband are child-free.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d13/2af/33e1085dbd82419b7c799b3c4f.jpg><p>Taylor Hackford has 2&nbsp;sons from his previous marriages&nbsp;— Rio and Alexander&nbsp;— so&nbsp;Helen can proudly call herself a&nbsp;step-mom. “I&nbsp;do love children and I’ve got family, and Taylor has children that I’m involved with&nbsp;— and with great pleasure&nbsp;— but it’s just not for&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>me</a>.”</p><p>“I&nbsp;never felt the need for a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>child</a>. Motherhood holds no&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interest</a> for&nbsp;me,” the actress stated. It’s not because she doesn’t love <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>children</a>&nbsp;— she does&nbsp;— but she never wanted to&nbsp;have them. “<strong>I&nbsp;really tried to&nbsp;want it&nbsp;at&nbsp;one point. But I&nbsp;never convinced myself.</strong> There are far too many people in&nbsp;the world. It’s my&nbsp;contribution to&nbsp;ecology. ”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9df/0bd/85225c513a97dd5980fa27387a.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;have never had a&nbsp;moment of&nbsp;regret about not having children. Well, I&nbsp;lie. When I&nbsp;watched the movie, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Parenthood</i></a>, <strong>I&nbsp;sobbed for about </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>20</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;minutes</strong>, I&nbsp;sobbed for the loss of&nbsp;the chance at&nbsp;parenthood and the fact that&nbsp;I never experienced&nbsp;it.” However, she confirmed she was soon quite relieved about not having children. “<strong>Then I&nbsp;got over it&nbsp;and&nbsp;I was happy again.</strong>”</p><p>What’s your and your partners’ secret to&nbsp;making a&nbsp;marriage work?
